    "High similarity between safety alignment datasets and downstream fine-tuning datasets significantly weakens LLM safety guardrails, making models more susceptible to jailbreaks and safety bypasses.",
    "Low similarity between alignment and fine-tuning datasets produces substantially more robust models, reducing harmfulness scores by up to 10.33% compared to high-similarity configurations.",
    "The research identifies representation similarity analysis as a proactive method to predict and prevent safety guardrail degradation before fine-tuning occurs, shifting from reactive to preventive safety measures.",
    "Upstream dataset design plays a critical role in building durable safety guardrails, suggesting that careful curation of alignment data relative to expected downstream tasks is essential for maintaining model safety.",
    "The study reveals that existing mitigation strategies focus too heavily on post-compromise solutions rather than addressing the fundamental dataset similarity issues that cause safety degradation in the first place."
