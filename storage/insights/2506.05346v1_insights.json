    "High similarity between safety alignment datasets and downstream fine-tuning datasets significantly weakens LLM safety guardrails, making models more susceptible to jailbreaks and safety bypasses.",
    "Low similarity between alignment and fine-tuning datasets produces substantially more robust models, reducing harmfulness scores by up to 10.33% compared to high-similarity configurations.",
    "The research identifies representation similarity analysis as a proactive method to predict and prevent safety guardrail degradation before fine-tuning occurs, shifting from reactive to preventive safety measures.",
    "Upstream dataset design plays a critical role in building durable safety guardrails, suggesting that careful curation of alignment data relative to expected fine-tuning tasks is essential for maintaining model safety.",
    "The study reveals that existing mitigation strategies focus too heavily on post-compromise solutions rather than addressing the fundamental dataset similarity issues that cause safety degradation in the first place."
