    "This is the first comprehensive survey consolidating camera trajectory generation methods across computer graphics, robotics, virtual reality, and cinematography, providing a unified framework for understanding different approaches from rule-based to machine learning techniques.",
    "The survey systematically categorizes camera trajectory generation into four main approaches: rule-based methods for deterministic movements, optimization-based techniques for constraint satisfaction, machine learning approaches for adaptive behavior, and hybrid methods that combine multiple strategies for enhanced performance.",
    "The paper establishes standardized evaluation frameworks by analyzing commonly used metrics and datasets for assessing camera trajectory systems, focusing on performance measurement, aesthetic quality assessment, and practical applicability in real-world scenarios.",
    "Different camera representation approaches are systematically compared, providing practitioners with clear guidance on selecting appropriate mathematical models and coordinate systems based on their specific application requirements and computational constraints.",
    "The survey identifies key research gaps and future directions in camera trajectory generation, highlighting opportunities for improved integration between different methodological approaches and the need for better evaluation standards across diverse application domains."
