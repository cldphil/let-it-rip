    "LSM-2 with Adaptive and Inherited Masking (AIM) learns robust representations directly from incomplete wearable sensor data without requiring explicit imputation, using learnable mask tokens to model both existing and artificially introduced missingness patterns.",
    "The model was pre-trained on an extensive dataset of 40 million hours of wearable sensor data, demonstrating significant scale in handling real-world incomplete sensor data scenarios.",
    "AIM shows +15% higher absolute performance in degraded states compared to baseline approaches across 12 ablation settings, making it more reliable for real-world deployment where missing data is common.",
    "The model demonstrates clinically coherent patterns with real-world implications, showing expected nocturnal advantage for hypertension and anxiety predictions with only 5% F1 degradation when nighttime signals are removed versus 0.4% and 0.01% for daytime windows.",
    "LSM-2 aligns strongly with clinical literature on the diagnostic value of nighttime biosignals for hypertension and stress prediction, as these are less affected by daily activity artifacts and better capture underlying pathophysiology."
