    "LLMs show significant performance disparities across different indexical types, with strong performance on first-person pronouns ('I') but struggling with second-person ('you'), spatial ('here'), and temporal ('tomorrow') indexicals, indicating context-dependent processing limitations.",
    "Syntactic cues like quotation marks have inconsistent effects on indexical resolution - improving performance for some indexicals while reducing it for others, suggesting the need for indexical-specific prompt engineering strategies.",
    "The study introduces the first English Indexical Dataset with 1600 multiple-choice questions specifically designed to evaluate coreference resolution beyond traditional nouns and third-person pronouns, providing a standardized benchmark for indexical understanding.",
    "Evaluation across four state-of-the-art models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and DeepSeek V3) reveals consistent patterns of indexical processing challenges, indicating fundamental limitations in current LLM architectures for context-dependent reference resolution.",
    "The research establishes that traditional coreference resolution evaluation methods are insufficient for assessing LLM capabilities with indexicals, requiring specialized testing frameworks that account for the unique linguistic properties of context-dependent references."
