    "The authors investigated the effects of applying dropout, including early dropout, during pretraining of masked language models (MLMs) like BERT-base and decoder language models like Pythia 160M and 1.4B.",
    "They pretrained these models with varying dropout rates (0.0, 0.1, 0.3) and applied early dropout (dropout only in the first 35% of training) to examine the impact on downstream performance.",
    "Surprisingly, they found that completely removing dropout (p=0.0), including early dropout, during pretraining yielded the most capable models across measures like morpho-syntactic understanding (BLiMP score) for decoder LMs and question answering for MLMs.",
    "The results suggest a tension between having distributed representations induced by dropout and more localist approaches, as recent work has shown language model performance varies based on consistency in processing inputs.",
    "The authors evaluated the pretrained models on metrics like language modeling loss, BLiMP score for decoder LMs, and question answering for MLMs to assess their downstream capabilities."
