    "MiCRo is a two-stage approach that first uses mixture modeling to capture diverse human preferences, and then employs an online routing strategy to dynamically adapt mixture weights based on specific contexts, allowing for efficient and scalable preference adaptation with minimal additional supervision.",
    "Experiments on multiple preference datasets demonstrate that MiCRo effectively captures diverse human preferences and significantly improves downstream personalization performance.",
    "The mixture modeling stage captures the diverse and often contradictory nature of human preferences, which existing methods relying on a single global reward function fail to address.",
    "The context-aware routing strategy resolves ambiguity by dynamically adapting mixture weights based on specific contexts, enabling efficient and scalable preference adaptation.",
    "MiCRo's ability to capture diverse preferences and adapt to specific contexts makes it well-suited for personalized applications where subjective evaluation and open-ended responses are involved."
