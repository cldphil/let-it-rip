    "VideoCAD is a large-scale synthetic dataset consisting of over 41K annotated video recordings of CAD operations, generated using an automated framework for collecting high-fidelity UI action data from human-made CAD designs.",
    "It offers an order of magnitude higher complexity in UI interaction learning for real-world engineering tasks, having up to a 20\u00d7 longer time horizon than other datasets.",
    "The authors propose VideoCADFormer, a state-of-the-art model for learning CAD interactions directly from video, which outperforms multiple behavior cloning baselines.",
    "VideoCAD introduces a visual question-answering (VQA) benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal large language models' (LLMs) spatial reasoning and video understanding abilities, consisting of 1,200 visual questions.",
    "The experiments highlight a critical gap in spatial reasoning of LLMs in precise engineering tasks, suggesting the need for precise action grounding, multi-modal and spatial reasoning, and long-horizon dependencies."
