    "HADA architecture provides a framework-agnostic solution for aligning AI agents and legacy algorithms with organizational values, supporting any underlying LLM, agent library, or orchestration stack without requiring redesign.",
    "The architecture enables natural-language interaction across multiple planning horizons, allowing stakeholders to communicate with software agents and AI algorithmic logic using conversational interfaces rather than technical specifications.",
    "Multi-dimensional alignment mechanism allows organizations to align stakeholder targets and values with both new AI agents and existing legacy algorithms through a unified approach that scales to thousands of agents while maintaining auditability.",
    "Integration with Objectives and Key Results (OKR) framework extends traditional organizational alignment processes to cover algorithmic decision-making, ensuring AI agents operate within established corporate governance structures and strategic objectives.",
    "The reference architecture addresses the critical gap in enterprise AI deployment where organizations lack rigorous methods to maintain alignment between rapidly deployed LLM agents and organizational targets, particularly as new protocols like MCP and A2A enable greater agent autonomy."
