    "DSG-World introduces a novel dual-state observation approach that uses two perturbed views of the same scene with different object configurations to overcome occlusion problems in 3D world modeling, eliminating the need for multi-stage processing like segmentation and inpainting.",
    "The framework builds dual segmentation-aware Gaussian fields with bidirectional photometric and semantic consistency enforcement, enabling more stable and complete 3D reconstruction compared to single-state methods.",
    "A pseudo-intermediate state mechanism is introduced for symmetric alignment between dual observations, combined with collaborative co-pruning and co-pasting strategies to refine geometric completeness of the 3D Gaussian world model.",
    "The end-to-end framework explicitly constructs 3D Gaussian World models that maintain physical consistency, addressing limitations of implicit generative models that are difficult to train and lack 3D coherence.",
    "The approach leverages complementary visibility from dual states to enable more efficient world modeling from limited observations, with potential applications in robotics and computer vision tasks requiring 3D scene understanding."
