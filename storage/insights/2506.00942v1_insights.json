    "anyECG-chat introduces a generalist multimodal large language model that supports flexible ECG inputs beyond the standard 12-lead 10-second format, enabling analysis of long-duration reduced-lead ECGs suitable for home monitoring environments and multi-ECG comparison scenarios commonly encountered in clinical practice.",
    "The researchers constructed the anyECG dataset encompassing diverse tasks including report generation, abnormal waveform localization with second-level precision, and open-ended question answering, addressing the limitation of existing monotonous ECG-QA datasets that primarily focus on single tasks.",
    "The model demonstrates superior fine-grained perceptual capabilities for ECG analysis, achieving precise temporal localization of abnormalities (e.g., identifying Premature ventricular contractions within 1.9s-3.7s duration) compared to existing models like LLaVa-Med and PULSE which can only provide lead-level localization.",
    "The system supports multi-ECG analysis scenarios with varying sampling intervals, enabling longitudinal patient monitoring and comparison of ECG changes over time, which is critical for clinical decision-making and patient care continuity.",
    "The approach extends MLLM capabilities beyond traditional report generation to comprehensive ECG understanding tasks, potentially transforming how healthcare providers interact with and interpret electrocardiogram data in both clinical and home monitoring settings."
