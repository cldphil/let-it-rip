    "LLM-First Search (LFS) eliminates the need for pre-defined search hyperparameters by allowing LLMs to autonomously control their own search process through internal scoring mechanisms, making it more adaptable across tasks of varying difficulty compared to fixed-parameter methods like MCTS.",
    "The method enables context-sensitive reasoning without requiring manual tuning or task-specific adaptation, addressing a key limitation of traditional search algorithms that rely on hardcoded policies and external heuristics.",
    "LFS was evaluated against three established search algorithms - Tree-of-Thoughts Breadth First Search (ToT-BFS), Best First Search (BestFS), and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) - on mathematical reasoning tasks including Countdown and Sudoku puzzles.",
    "The approach uses self-guided exploration where the LLM evaluates whether to pursue current search paths or explore alternative branches based on its own assessment, removing dependency on external search strategy configuration.",
    "Implementation involves structured prompting with color-coded components for task-specific instructions (green), system-level behavior definitions (red), and user queries (blue), with Python variable formatting for dynamic content insertion."
