    "LLM-First Search (LFS) eliminates the need for pre-defined search hyperparameters by allowing LLMs to autonomously control their own search process through internal scoring mechanisms, making it more adaptable across tasks of varying difficulty compared to fixed-parameter methods like MCTS.",
    "The method addresses a critical limitation of existing search approaches like Monte Carlo Tree Search and Tree-of-Thoughts Breadth First Search, which rely on hardcoded policies and external heuristics that require manual tuning for different tasks.",
    "LFS enables context-sensitive reasoning by empowering the LLM to evaluate whether to pursue current search paths or explore alternative branches based on its own assessment, removing dependency on task-specific adaptation requirements.",
    "The approach was evaluated on structured problem-solving tasks including Countdown numbers game and Sudoku puzzles, demonstrating practical applicability to combinatorial optimization and constraint satisfaction problems.",
    "The research contributes to the broader trend of using increased test-time compute for improved LLM reasoning and planning, offering a more flexible alternative to traditional search algorithms in AI problem-solving applications."
