    "Rectified Sparse Attention (ReSA) combines block-sparse attention with periodic dense rectification to achieve up to 2.42x end-to-end speedup for 256K sequence length decoding while maintaining near-lossless generation quality.",
    "The method addresses KV cache misalignment in sparse decoding by refreshing the KV cache at fixed intervals using dense forward passes, which bounds error accumulation and preserves alignment with pretraining distribution.",
    "ReSA demonstrates effectiveness across multiple domains including math reasoning, language modeling, and retrieval tasks, showing its versatility for long-context inference applications.",
    "The approach is simple yet effective, requiring only periodic dense rectification combined with existing block-sparse attention mechanisms, making it practical for implementation in existing LLM systems.",
    "The method enables scalable long-context inference for Large Language Models processing contexts up to millions of tokens, addressing a critical challenge in modern LLM deployment for long-sequence generation tasks."
