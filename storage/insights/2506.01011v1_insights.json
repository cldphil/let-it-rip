    "Lexical BiasWatermarking (LBW) introduces a novel watermarking approach specifically designed for autoregressive image generation models that embeds watermarks directly into token maps by biasing token selection toward a predefined green list during generation, addressing the gap in watermarking techniques for AR models.",
    "The proposed method demonstrates resistance to regeneration attacks, which are a significant vulnerability in existing diffusion-based watermarking techniques where attackers can erase watermarks by perturbing diffusion latent states.",
    "LBW ensures seamless integration with existing autoregressive models without requiring architectural modifications, making it practically deployable for current AR image generation systems while maintaining generation quality.",
    "The framework operates through sequential token prediction watermarking, which aligns naturally with the autoregressive generation process, providing a more robust alternative to diffusion latent state embedding approaches.",
    "This research addresses the growing need for robust watermarking solutions as autoregressive image generation models gain prominence, providing a foundation for preventing misuse of AI-generated content in practical applications."
