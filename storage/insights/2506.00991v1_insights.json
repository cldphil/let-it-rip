    "GOBench introduces a specialized benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on geometric optics tasks, addressing a critical gap in physics-based visual understanding evaluation.",
    "The benchmark evaluates both generation and understanding capabilities of MLLMs through optical phenomena like refraction, reflection, and shadow formation, using a dual assessment approach combining automated metrics and human evaluation.",
    "The evaluation framework incorporates three key metrics: optical principle accuracy (physics correctness), aesthetic quality rating (1-5 scale), and instruction consistency rating (1-5 scale) to provide comprehensive assessment.",
    "The benchmark includes real-world optical scenarios such as pencil refraction in water and shadow casting, enabling practical evaluation of MLLMs' ability to understand and generate physically accurate visual content.",
    "The research establishes a foundation for improving MLLM performance in scientific visual reasoning tasks, particularly in physics education and optical simulation applications."
