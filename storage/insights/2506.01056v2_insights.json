    "MCP-Zero introduces a proactive tool request paradigm where LLMs dynamically request specific tools as needed rather than loading all available tools upfront, reducing context overhead and improving efficiency in multi-step task execution.",
    "The framework consists of three core components: Proactive Tool Request (model emits tool needs), lightweight tool indexing with semantic descriptions, and high-precision retrieval based on semantic alignment rather than simple query matching.",
    "Unlike traditional approaches that inject thousands of tool schemas into prompts (causing excessive length) or retrieval-augmented methods that select tools once per query (leading to insufficient selection), MCP-Zero enables iterative tool discovery and dynamic toolchain construction.",
    "Implementation requires three straightforward steps: prompting LLMs to explicitly request tools, maintaining a semantic tool index, and leveraging improved semantic alignment for retrieval - making it accessible for integration into existing agent frameworks.",
    "The approach addresses scalability issues in tool-using agents by moving from static tool loading to dynamic tool discovery, enabling cost-efficient agent systems that can handle complex multi-turn scenarios with minimal context overhead."
