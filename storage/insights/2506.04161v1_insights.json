    "VISCA introduces a novel hierarchical component abstraction method that transforms webpages into semantically rich UI components using heuristic-based segmentation followed by multimodal LLM-driven classification, achieving 92% average feature coverage in automated E2E test generation.",
    "The approach demonstrates a 16% performance improvement over state-of-the-art LLM-based E2E test generation methods by providing better contextual input through component-centric abstraction rather than raw webpage analysis.",
    "VISCA employs a two-stage process: first partitioning webpages into candidate segments using novel heuristics, then using multimodal LLMs to classify and extract contextual information from these segments into predefined UI component vocabularies.",
    "The method addresses the critical challenge of providing optimal contextual input for LLM-based automated testing, which current approaches inadequately handle, by creating more effective contextual basis for feature inference.",
    "The component abstraction approach enables more robust E2E test case generation by transforming complex webpage structures into manageable, semantically meaningful units that LLMs can better understand and work with."
