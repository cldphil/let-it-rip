    "R-Search framework achieves up to 37.2% improvement on complex multi-hop QA tasks compared to Vanilla RAG and LLM without search, demonstrating significant performance gains for knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks.",
    "The multi-reward reinforcement learning approach enables LLMs to dynamically decide when to retrieve information versus when to reason, optimizing the reasoning-search interaction trajectory through multi-stage, multi-type rewards.",
    "R-Search shows strong generalization across both simple and complex reasoning tasks, delivering up to 4.2% gains on single-hop datasets while excelling at multi-hop questions where branching RAG methods like SuRe show performance drops.",
    "The framework uses specific hyperparameters including KL divergence coefficient \u03b2=0.001 and fixed \u03b3e and \u03b3\u03b1 values of 0.2, providing concrete implementation guidance for practitioners.",
    "R-Search addresses the critical challenge of suboptimal reasoning-search interaction trajectories in LLMs, enabling autonomous multi-step reasoning with deep search interaction for complex logic and knowledge-intensive tasks."
