    "The paper establishes a comprehensive TRiSM framework with four core pillars (governance, explainability, ModelOps, and privacy/security) specifically designed for LLM-based agentic multi-agent systems, addressing the unique challenges of autonomous AI agents that can use tools and make decisions independently.",
    "A novel risk taxonomy is introduced that identifies unique threat vectors specific to agentic AI systems, including agent-to-agent communication vulnerabilities, tool misuse risks, and emergent behaviors from multi-agent interactions that don't exist in traditional single-agent systems.",
    "The research provides specific evaluation metrics across five dimensions: reliability (confidence vs. outcomes calibration, fairness indices), explainability (explanation fidelity, human interpretability ratings), user-centered metrics (satisfaction scores, goal fulfillment rates), coordination effectiveness (multi-agent task completion rates, communication overhead), and composite performance measures.",
    "Trust-building mechanisms are contextualized for distributed LLM agent systems, including transparency techniques and oversight methods that account for the complexity of multi-agent coordination and the need for real-time monitoring of autonomous decision-making processes.",
    "The framework addresses the scalability challenges of deploying agentic AI in enterprise and societal domains, providing structured approaches for managing the increased complexity and risk profile of systems where multiple AI agents collaborate autonomously with access to external tools and APIs."
