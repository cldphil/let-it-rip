    "FedQuad introduces adaptive layer-wise LoRA deployment that adjusts LoRA depth (number of consecutive tunable layers from output) based on individual device computational capabilities, enabling heterogeneous federated fine-tuning of large language models while maintaining model performance across resource-constrained devices.",
    "The framework combines LoRA parameter efficiency with activation quantization to significantly reduce memory overhead during backpropagation, addressing the major barrier of activation storage requirements that prevent deployment on edge devices with limited memory capacity.",
    "FedQuad implements an adaptive weighted aggregation mechanism at the parameter server that handles varying LoRA depths across participating devices, solving the synchronization bottleneck problem caused by resource heterogeneity in federated learning environments.",
    "The system uses a configuration optimization approach where each device uploads its resource status and receives tailored training configurations (LoRA depth and activation quantization layers) for each training round, enabling dynamic resource allocation based on real-time device capabilities.",
    "This work addresses the critical gap between federated fine-tuning theoretical frameworks and practical deployment on resource-heterogeneous edge devices, providing a scalable solution for privacy-preserving LLM fine-tuning in real-world distributed environments with varying computational resources."
