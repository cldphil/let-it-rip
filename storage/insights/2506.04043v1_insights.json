    "LLM-generated counter-narratives are often verbose and require college-level literacy, significantly limiting their accessibility for broader audiences and reducing their effectiveness in real-world hate speech mitigation scenarios.",
    "Emotionally guided prompts produce more empathetic and readable counter-narrative responses compared to standard prompting approaches, though safety and effectiveness concerns persist in practical deployment.",
    "A comprehensive evaluation framework across four dimensions (persona framing, verbosity/readability, affective tone, and ethical robustness) provides a systematic approach for assessing automated counter-narrative quality using GPT-4o-Mini, CommandR-7B, and LLaMA 3.1-70B models.",
    "Three distinct prompting strategies were tested on MT-Conan and HatEval datasets, revealing significant variations in response quality and appropriateness across different model architectures and prompt designs.",
    "The shift from centralized fact-checking to community-driven moderation on social media platforms creates new opportunities and challenges for automated counter-narrative systems, requiring careful consideration of ethical implications and user safety."
