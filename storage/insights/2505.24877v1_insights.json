    "Existing methods for image-to-3D avatar generation struggle to produce highly\ndetailed, animation-ready avatars suitable for real-world applications. We\nintroduce AdaHuman, a novel framework that generates high-fidelity animatable\n3D avatars from a single in-the-wild image. AdaHuman incorporates two key\ninnovations: (1) A pose-conditioned 3D joint diffusion model that synthesizes\nconsistent multi-view images in arbitrary poses alongside corresponding 3D\nGaussian Splats (3DGS) reconstruction at each diffusion step; (2) A\ncompositional 3DGS refinement module that enhances the details of local body\nparts through image-to-image refinement and seamlessly integrates them using a\nnovel crop-aware camera ray map, producing a cohesive detailed 3D avatar. These\ncomponents allow AdaHuman to generate highly realistic standardized A-pose\navatars with minimal self-occlusion, enabling rigging and animation with any\ninput motion.",
    "Extensive evaluation on public benchmarks and in-the-wild images\ndemonstrates that AdaHuman significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nin both avatar reconstruction and reposing. Code and models will be publicly\navailable for research purposes."
