    "AdaHuman introduces a novel framework for generating high-fidelity animatable 3D avatars from a single in-the-wild image, addressing the limitations of previous methods that struggle to produce highly detailed, animation-ready avatars.",
    "It incorporates a pose-conditioned 3D joint diffusion model that synthesizes consistent multi-view images in arbitrary poses alongside corresponding 3D Gaussian Splats (3DGS) reconstruction at each diffusion step.",
    "It also includes a compositional 3DGS refinement module that enhances the details of local body parts through image-to-image refinement and seamlessly integrates them using a novel crop-aware camera ray map, producing a cohesive detailed 3D avatar.",
    "Extensive evaluation on public benchmarks and in-the-wild images demonstrates that AdaHuman significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both avatar reconstruction and reposing.",
    "AdaHuman generates highly realistic standardized A-pose avatars with minimal self-occlusion, enabling rigging and animation with any input motion, addressing a significant challenge in previous methods."
