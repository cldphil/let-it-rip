    "XAI-Units introduces a unit testing framework for evaluating feature attribution methods in explainable AI, addressing the critical problem of disagreeing importance scores between different FA methods when no ground truth exists.",
    "The benchmark uses handcrafted neural networks with known ground truth to systematically evaluate FA methods, enabling objective comparison of explainability techniques across diverse model types and contexts.",
    "A case study revealed implementation discrepancies in DeepLIFT within Captum library, demonstrating how the benchmark can identify gaps between theoretical design specifications and actual implementations of FA methods.",
    "The framework is delivered as an open-source Python package that streamlines evaluation procedures, allowing researchers to effortlessly run experiments across multiple FA methods with extensible support for custom attribution methods and evaluation metrics.",
    "The approach enables accountability for FA method developers by verifying whether design specifications are fulfilled in practice, promoting more reliable and trustworthy explainable AI implementations across different application domains."
