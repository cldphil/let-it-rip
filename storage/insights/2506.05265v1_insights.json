    "AI-augmented team optimization frameworks can address the limitations of static algorithmic approaches by incorporating dynamic personality factors, evolving goals, and changing individual preferences to enhance team satisfaction and performance.",
    "The research identifies two critical stages requiring AI intervention: team formation stage (balancing user preferences with task objectives) and team performing stage (maintaining cohesion and engagement through personalized guidance).",
    "Existing computational tools for team optimization fail because they rely on static data inputs, narrow algorithmic objectives, and context-specific solutions that don't account for the dynamic interplay of team member characteristics.",
    "The proposed framework aims to provide timely, personalized guidance to help team members adjust their behaviors and interactions as team dynamics evolve, addressing the gap in current team optimization approaches.",
    "The research contributes to the broader field of human-computer interaction by developing practical systems that can be applied across diverse domains where effective teamwork is essential."
