    "DiCoRe framework achieves 4-7% average F1 score improvements over existing zero-shot event detection baselines by decoupling the task into two specialized components: Dreamer for divergent reasoning and open-ended event discovery, and Grounder for convergent reasoning with finite-state machine guided constrained decoding.",
    "The divergent-convergent reasoning approach effectively addresses LLM limitations in zero-shot event detection by separating event discovery from structured output formatting, reducing cognitive overload on the model while maintaining high precision through an LLM-Judge verification component.",
    "Extensive validation across six datasets spanning five domains and nine different LLMs demonstrates consistent performance improvements, indicating the framework's robustness and generalizability across different model architectures and domain-specific applications.",
    "The framework uses finite-state machine guided constrained decoding in the Grounder component to ensure outputs conform to task-specific instructions and event ontology requirements, providing a systematic approach to structure free-form LLM predictions.",
    "The modular design enables practitioners to adapt the framework for specialized domains without requiring training data, making it particularly valuable for document understanding in domains where labeled event detection data is scarce or unavailable."
