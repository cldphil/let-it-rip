    "DiCoRe framework achieves 4-7% average F1 score improvements over existing zero-shot event detection baselines by decoupling the task into two specialized components: Dreamer for divergent reasoning and open-ended event discovery, and Grounder for convergent reasoning with finite-state machine guided constrained decoding.",
    "The divergent-convergent reasoning approach effectively addresses the limitation of LLMs being overloaded by complex event ontologies, domain-specific trigger extraction, and structured output requirements in zero-shot scenarios, making it practical for specialized domains without training data.",
    "Extensive validation across six datasets spanning five domains and nine different LLMs demonstrates consistent performance improvements, indicating the framework's robustness and generalizability across different model architectures and domain contexts.",
    "The integration of an LLM-Judge component for output verification ensures high precision in final predictions, providing a quality control mechanism that balances the increased coverage from divergent reasoning with accuracy requirements.",
    "The framework specifically targets document understanding in specialized domains where training data is scarce, offering a practical solution for industries requiring event detection in domain-specific contexts without the need for extensive labeled datasets."
