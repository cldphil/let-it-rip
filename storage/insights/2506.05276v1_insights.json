    "The COCKTAIL EDIT framework introduces multi-grained control for time series editing, combining confidence-weighted control for point-wise constraints with classifier-based control for segment-level statistical properties like sums and averages, enabling simultaneous flexible control across different constraint types.",
    "The approach achieves precise local control during the denoising inference stage of diffusion models while maintaining temporal coherence, making it compatible with any conditionally trained diffusion-based time series models without requiring model retraining.",
    "The framework addresses a critical gap in time series generation by enabling both point-level modifications and segment-level statistical control, which current methods struggle to handle simultaneously while preserving the overall temporal structure.",
    "The diffusion-driven approach operates during inference time, making it highly practical for deployment as it can be integrated with existing pre-trained diffusion models without additional training overhead or architectural modifications.",
    "The research demonstrates broad applicability across diverse datasets and models, suggesting the framework can be adopted across different domains requiring controlled time series generation, from financial forecasting to sensor data manipulation."
