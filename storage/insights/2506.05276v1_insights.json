    "The COCKTAIL EDIT framework introduces multi-grained control for time series editing, combining confidence-weighted control for point-wise constraints with classifier-based control for segment-level statistical properties like sums and averages, enabling simultaneous flexible control across different constraint types.",
    "The approach achieves precise local control during the denoising inference stage of diffusion models while maintaining temporal coherence, making it compatible with any conditionally trained diffusion-based time series models without requiring model retraining.",
    "The framework addresses a critical gap in time series generation by enabling both point-level modifications and segment-level statistical control, which current methods struggle to handle simultaneously while preserving the overall temporal structure.",
    "The solution integrates seamlessly with existing diffusion-based time series models, suggesting low implementation barriers for organizations already using diffusion models for time series generation, with control mechanisms applied during inference rather than training.",
    "Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate the framework's versatility and robustness, indicating potential for broad application across different time series domains including financial data, sensor readings, and other temporal sequences."
