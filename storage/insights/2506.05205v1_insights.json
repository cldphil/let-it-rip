    "RELIC framework introduces a novel evaluation method for LLM instruction following using formal language recognition tasks that require composing multiple grammar production rules from context, providing a more rigorous test of compositional reasoning than standard benchmarks.",
    "State-of-the-art LLMs show predictable performance degradation based on grammar complexity and string complexity, with even advanced models achieving near-chance performance on complex grammars, revealing fundamental limitations in compositional instruction following.",
    "The synthetic nature of RELIC tasks enables automatic generation of new test instances and scalable complexity adjustment, effectively mitigating data contamination issues that plague many existing LLM evaluation benchmarks.",
    "LLM accuracy can be reliably predicted from measurable complexity metrics of both the grammar structure and individual example strings, providing a systematic framework for understanding model capabilities and limitations.",
    "The framework enables diagnostic analysis of how LLMs attempt to solve increasingly complex compositional tasks, offering insights into failure modes and reasoning strategies that can inform model development and deployment decisions."
