    "State-Covering Trajectory Stitching (SCoTS) addresses the fundamental limitation of diffusion-based planners by augmenting training data through systematic trajectory stitching, enabling better generalization to tasks outside the original training distribution and longer planning horizons.",
    "The method employs a two-stage approach: first learning temporal distance-preserving latent representations to capture environment structure, then iteratively stitching trajectory segments using directional exploration and novelty guidance to expand latent space coverage.",
    "SCoTS operates as a reward-free trajectory augmentation method, making it applicable across diverse reinforcement learning scenarios without requiring task-specific reward engineering or domain knowledge.",
    "The approach demonstrates significant performance improvements for both diffusion planners and widely used offline goal-conditioned RL algorithms on benchmarks requiring trajectory stitching and long-horizon reasoning capabilities.",
    "The method provides a systematic solution to data quality and diversity limitations in offline RL by generating extended trajectories that maintain temporal coherence while exploring novel state combinations not present in original datasets."
