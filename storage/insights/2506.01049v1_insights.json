    "SGG (Scaling with Gradient Grouping) is an optimizer wrapper that improves adaptive learning rate estimation by dynamically grouping gradient statistics within each layer into clusters and applying cluster-specific scaling to calibrate learning rates for individual parameters.",
    "The method addresses training instability, slow convergence, and poor compatibility with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques that plague current adaptive optimizers like AdamW when training large language models.",
    "SGG integrates seamlessly with existing optimizers as a wrapper, offering consistent performance gains and faster convergence across various model sizes without requiring replacement of the underlying optimization algorithm.",
    "The approach maintains precise per-parameter adaptation while imposing collective group-wise constraints, balancing individual parameter needs with layer-level coordination for more stable training dynamics.",
    "Experiments demonstrate robust performance across varying batch sizes and learning rates, establishing SGG as a stable choice for LLM optimization that can handle the heterogeneous architectures and massive scale of modern language models."
