    "Selective Unlearning (SU) identifies and removes only critical tokens relevant to unwanted information rather than indiscriminately forgetting all tokens in target documents, preserving common tokens like pronouns and prepositions that carry general knowledge.",
    "The approach significantly preserves model utility on retained data while achieving effective unlearning on targeted forget data, addressing the key trade-off problem in LLM unlearning where removing sensitive content typically degrades overall model performance.",
    "SU demonstrates compatibility across six different baseline unlearning algorithms and shows consistent improvements on two benchmarks, indicating the method's generalizability and robustness across different unlearning frameworks.",
    "The token selection mechanism focuses on identifying tokens that are specifically relevant to unwanted information (private, sensitive, or copyrighted content) while leaving general knowledge tokens intact, requiring sophisticated token importance scoring.",
    "This research addresses critical compliance needs for LLMs deployed in production environments where organizations must remove specific content due to privacy regulations, copyright claims, or data protection requirements without retraining entire models."

  "limitations": [
    "Limited details provided on the specific token selection criteria and scoring mechanisms used to identify critical vs. common tokens",
    "Evaluation limited to two benchmarks and may not generalize to all types of sensitive content or domain-specific unlearning scenarios"
