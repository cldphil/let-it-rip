    "Automatic best-worst scaling with large language models achieves superior performance compared to traditional supervised approaches for embodied emotion classification, demonstrating a more efficient annotation and training paradigm.",
    "Simplified prompting instructions combined with chain-of-thought reasoning significantly improve emotion recognition accuracy, with simplified 2-step CoT prompts yielding F1-score increases of 6.7 points over complex prompting approaches.",
    "Smaller models (8B parameters) can achieve competitive performance with larger models (70B parameters) when using optimized prompting strategies - DeepSeek 8B with simple 2-step prompts performed within 6.7 F1-points of its 70B counterpart and 2.7 F1-points of GPT-3.5.",
    "Three-step chain-of-thought reasoning consistently outperforms 2-step variants across different model architectures, indicating that deeper reasoning processes are more effective for embodied emotion detection tasks.",
    "The research extends embodied emotion classification from binary classification to Ekman's six basic emotion categories (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise), providing a more nuanced framework for understanding physical manifestations of emotions in text."
