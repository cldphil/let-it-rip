    "Story visualization, which aims to generate a sequence of visually coherent\nimages aligning with a given narrative and reference images, has seen\nsignificant progress with recent advancements in generative models. To further\nenhance the performance of story visualization frameworks in real-world\nscenarios, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, ViStoryBench. We\ncollect a diverse dataset encompassing various story types and artistic styles,\nensuring models are evaluated across multiple dimensions such as different\nplots (e.g., comedy, horror) and visual aesthetics (e.g., anime, 3D\nrenderings). ViStoryBench is carefully curated to balance narrative structures\nand visual elements, featuring stories with single and multiple protagonists to\ntest models' ability to maintain character consistency. Additionally, it\nincludes complex plots and intricate world-building to challenge models in\ngenerating accurate visuals.",
    "To ensure comprehensive comparisons, our benchmark\nincorporates a wide range of evaluation metrics assessing critical aspects.\nThis structured and multifaceted framework enables researchers to thoroughly\nidentify both the strengths and weaknesses of different models, fostering\ntargeted improvements."
