    "CLATTER introduces a systematic 3-step reasoning process for hallucination detection: (i) claim decomposition breaking text into smaller facts, (ii) sub-claim attribution and entailment classification finding evidence for each fact, and (iii) aggregated classification combining results for final decision.",
    "The approach treats hallucination detection as a natural language inference (NLI) task, using LLMs to classify whether generated text is entailed by reference texts through explicit reasoning processes similar to Chain-of-Thought reasoning.",
    "Guided comprehensive reasoning that decomposes text into granular facts and systematically finds supporting evidence enables much finer-grained and more accurate entailment decisions compared to direct classification approaches.",
    "The framework includes analysis metrics to measure the quality of intermediate reasoning steps, allowing for better understanding and optimization of the hallucination detection process.",
    "The systematic decomposition approach addresses the complexity of entailment classification by breaking down the reasoning task into manageable components that can be individually verified against source material."
