    "CLATTER introduces a systematic 3-step reasoning process for hallucination detection: (i) claim decomposition breaking text into smaller facts, (ii) sub-claim attribution and entailment classification finding evidence for each fact, and (iii) aggregated classification combining results for final decision.",
    "The approach treats hallucination detection as a natural language inference (NLI) task, using LLMs to classify whether generated text is entailed by reference texts through explicit reasoning processes similar to Chain-of-Thought reasoning.",
    "Guided systematic reasoning that decomposes text into granular facts and finds supporting evidence enables much finer-grained and accurate entailment decisions compared to direct classification approaches.",
    "The framework includes analysis metrics to measure the quality of intermediate reasoning steps, allowing for better understanding and optimization of the hallucination detection process.",
    "The comprehensive entailment reasoning approach can be applied to improve reliability of LLM outputs across various text generation tasks by providing structured verification against source materials."
