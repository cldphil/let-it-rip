  "key_findings": [
    "Developed an adaptive asynchronous LLM agent that makes dual decisions of 'what to say' and 'when to say it' in group communication settings, addressing a critical gap in current synchronous LLM applications.",
    "Agent achieved human-level performance in Mafia games both in gameplay effectiveness and ability to blend in with human players, demonstrating successful integration in complex social gaming environments.",
    "Agent's timing behavior closely mirrors human communication patterns in asynchronous settings, showing successful modeling of natural conversation flow and social dynamics.",
    "Created and released a unique dataset of online Mafia games with mixed human-AI participants, providing valuable benchmark data for future asynchronous communication research.",
    "Identified key differences between AI and human message content while maintaining similar timing patterns, revealing important insights about the dual nature of communication timing versus content generation."
