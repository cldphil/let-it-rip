  "key_findings": [
    "Developed an adaptive asynchronous LLM agent that makes dual decisions of 'what to say' and 'when to say it' in group communication settings, addressing a critical gap in current synchronous LLM applications that rely on turn-based interactions.",
    "Agent achieved human-level performance in Mafia games both in gameplay effectiveness and ability to blend in with human players, demonstrating successful integration in complex social gaming environments requiring deception, strategy, and natural communication patterns.",
    "Agent's timing behavior closely mirrors human communication patterns in asynchronous settings, showing that LLMs can learn appropriate social timing cues for group interactions without explicit turn-taking protocols.",
    "Created and released a unique dataset of online Mafia games with mixed human-AI participants, providing valuable training data for future asynchronous communication research and establishing benchmarks for social AI evaluation.",
    "Identified key differences between AI and human message content despite similar timing patterns, revealing areas where current LLMs still struggle with natural language generation in social contexts and providing direction for improving conversational AI authenticity."
