    "The paper proposes an approach to generate synthetic ABSA (Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis) data using the GPT-4o large language model, aiming to produce data with consistent topic and sentiment distributions across multiple domains.",
    "The quality and utility of the generated synthetic data were evaluated by assessing the performance of three state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and DeepSeek-R1) on topic and sentiment classification tasks.",
    "The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the synthetic data, revealing distinct performance trade-offs among the models: DeepSeek-R1 showed higher precision, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Claude 3.5 Sonnet exhibited strong recall, and Gemini 1.5 Pro offered significantly faster inference.",
    "The authors conclude that LLM-based synthetic data generation is a viable and flexible method for creating valuable ABSA resources, facilitating research and model evaluation without reliance on limited or inaccessible real-world labeled data.",
    "The synthetic data generation approach using GPT-4o addresses the scarcity of diverse, labeled datasets that reflect real-world conversational nuances in the ABSA domain."
