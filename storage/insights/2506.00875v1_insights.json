    "CC-Tuning introduces a novel cross-lingual connection mechanism that operates at the latent level by fusing feed-forward activations from both English and non-English inputs during training, addressing the fundamental issue of imbalanced multilingual capabilities in LLMs caused by English-centric training data.",
    "The method employs a trainable Decision Maker component that intelligently identifies beneficial activations from cross-lingual interactions, enabling selective fusion of linguistic resources rather than naive combination of all cross-lingual features.",
    "During inference, CC-Tuning utilizes a Transform Matrix to simulate cross-lingual connections in monolingual settings, allowing the model to leverage cross-lingual knowledge even when processing single-language inputs without requiring paired multilingual data at inference time.",
    "The approach operates beyond traditional data-level techniques like data augmentation or distillation by establishing explicit latent-level cross-lingual interactions, representing a paradigm shift from implicit to explicit cross-lingual alignment in multilingual fine-tuning.",
    "CC-Tuning provides a systematic framework for improving joint multilingual supervised fine-tuning that can potentially be applied across different language pairs and tasks, offering a scalable solution for enhancing multilingual model performance without extensive data preprocessing."
