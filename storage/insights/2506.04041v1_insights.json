    "LLMs demonstrate superior performance on legal event ordering compared to narrative texts, achieving up to 10.5% higher accuracy, indicating that legal language structure may actually facilitate temporal reasoning tasks.",
    "Longer input contexts significantly improve temporal ordering accuracy, with implicit-explicit event pairs reaching 80.8% accuracy, suggesting that providing more contextual information enhances model understanding of temporal relationships.",
    "Legal linguistic complexities and nested clauses remain challenging for current LLMs, highlighting the need for specialized modeling strategies to handle complex legal sentence structures and embedded temporal information.",
    "The LEXTIME dataset provides 512 annotated instances from U.S. Federal Complaints with expert-validated temporal relations, offering the first standardized benchmark for evaluating temporal reasoning in legal contexts.",
    "The research demonstrates that implicit events (those not explicitly stated but inferred) paired with explicit events yield better performance than explicit-explicit pairs, suggesting models benefit from mixed temporal reasoning tasks in legal contexts."

  "limitations": [
    "Dataset size is relatively small with only 512 instances, which may limit generalizability across diverse legal domains",
    "Focus is limited to U.S. Federal Complaints, potentially missing temporal reasoning patterns in other legal document types"
