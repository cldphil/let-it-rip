    "PromptVFX achieves 30x faster 3D animation generation compared to existing diffusion-based methods by reformulating 3D animation as a field prediction task rather than using computationally intensive diffusion models for 4D inference.",
    "The framework leverages large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for function generation, enabling interpretation of arbitrary natural language prompts like 'make the vase glow orange, then explode' to control 3D Gaussian properties in real-time.",
    "The system operates directly on 3D Gaussians by inferring time-varying 4D flow fields, avoiding computational overheads from mesh extraction, manual simulations, or physics-based simulations that traditional VFX pipelines require.",
    "Real-time animation generation is achieved in under 1 minute compared to 10-30 minutes for existing methods, making it practical for interactive applications in films, games, and AR/VR environments.",
    "The approach democratizes VFX creation by eliminating the need for specialized expertise and training in complex 3D animation software, potentially transforming content creation workflows across entertainment industries."
