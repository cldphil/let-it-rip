    "The proposed Chameleon framework employs leverage scores to quantify domain importance within a learned embedding space, allowing for efficient data mixing during language model pretraining and finetuning.",
    "Chameleon constructs a domain affinity matrix over domain embeddings, and the induced leverage scores determine a mixture that upweights domains sharing common representations in the embedding space.",
    "Experiments showed that Chameleon's computed weights improved performance on pretraining domains with a fraction of the compute compared to existing methods.",
    "Chameleon can adapt to data changes without proxy retraining, boosting few-shot reasoning accuracies when transferred to new data.",
    "On finetuning tasks, Chameleon enabled efficient domain reweighting, consistently improving test perplexity on all finetuning domains over uniform mixture baselines."
