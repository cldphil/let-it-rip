    "Large language models (LLMs) have shown great success in text modeling tasks\nacross domains.",
    "Recent studies have\nalso shown that not respecting the geometry of token embeddings leads to\ntraining instabilities and degradation of generative capabilities.",
    "These\nfindings suggest that shifting to non-Euclidean geometries can better align\nlanguage models with the underlying geometry of text.",
    "Our results show\nconsistent gains from our HELM architectures -- up to 4% -- over popular\nEuclidean architectures used in LLaMA and DeepSeek, highlighting the efficacy\nand enhanced reasoning afforded by hyperbolic geometry in large-scale LM\npretraining."
