    "Difficulty-targeted online data selection significantly improves RL fine-tuning efficiency by prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that yield more informative learning signals, avoiding both trivial and overly complex examples that provide limited training value.",
    "An attention-based framework enables efficient difficulty estimation by requiring rollouts for only a small reference set of questions, then estimating adaptive difficulty for remaining questions based on similarity to this reference set, dramatically reducing computational overhead.",
    "Rollout replay mechanism reuses recent rollouts to lower per-step computation while maintaining stable updates, providing a practical way to reduce resource consumption without sacrificing training quality in RL fine-tuning.",
    "The combined approach was validated across 6 LLM-dataset combinations, demonstrating broad applicability across different model architectures and problem domains for improving reasoning capabilities through more efficient RL fine-tuning.",
    "The research addresses a critical gap in LLM RL fine-tuning by focusing on data efficiency rather than just performance, providing practical techniques that make RL fine-tuning more accessible for resource-constrained environments while maintaining effectiveness."
