    "Difficulty-targeted online data selection significantly improves RL fine-tuning efficiency by prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that yield more informative learning signals, avoiding both trivial and overly complex examples that provide limited training value.",
    "An attention-based framework enables efficient difficulty estimation by requiring rollouts for only a small reference set of questions, then estimating adaptive difficulty for remaining questions based on similarity to this reference set, dramatically reducing computational overhead.",
    "Rollout replay mechanism reuses recent rollouts to lower per-step computation while maintaining stable model updates, providing a practical way to reduce resource consumption without sacrificing training quality.",
    "The combined approach demonstrates effectiveness across 6 different LLM-dataset combinations, indicating broad applicability across various model architectures and problem domains for reasoning task enhancement.",
    "The methodology addresses a critical gap in existing RL fine-tuning approaches by focusing on data efficiency rather than just performance, making advanced LLM training more accessible to organizations with limited computational resources."
