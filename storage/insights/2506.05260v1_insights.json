    "DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) suffers from likelihood displacement where both winning and losing response probabilities decrease during training, inadvertently boosting non-target responses - this problem intensifies with video content complexity.",
    "LeanPO introduces a reference-free approach that reformulates implicit reward as average likelihood of responses with respect to the policy model, eliminating the need for reference models used in traditional DPO.",
    "The method includes a reward-trustworthiness correlated self-generated preference data pipeline that creates high-quality paired training data through self-reflection and continuous refinement.",
    "LeanPO specifically addresses the redundant complexity of video content that exacerbates likelihood displacement issues in Video-LLMs compared to text-only LLMs.",
    "The approach enables policy models to obtain better preference data estimation and mitigates the likelihood displacement problem through careful infusion of relevant prior knowledge during training."
