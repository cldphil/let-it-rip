    "The proposed approach incorporates causal knowledge about the environment into large language models (LLMs) to enhance their ability to understand and reason about the environment, thereby supporting reinforcement learning (RL) agents in more effectively interacting with the environment and improving policy learning.",
    "Previous works either used RL agents alone or integrated LLMs to assist RL agents in interacting with the environment, but the proposed method aims to improve upon these by incorporating causal knowledge into the LLMs.",
    "The authors argue that while pre-trained LLMs are good at predicting the next token based on existing data, they have limitations in reasoning structurally and adapting to new environments, which hinders their effectiveness in complex decision-making tasks.",
    "By combining causal knowledge with LLMs, the proposed approach aims to enhance the LLMs' reasoning abilities and environmental adaptability, which could lead to improved performance in complex decision-making tasks.",
    "The authors suggest that their approach is unique in its integration of causal knowledge into LLMs, which could potentially address the limitations of existing methods that use either RL agents alone or LLMs to assist RL agents."
