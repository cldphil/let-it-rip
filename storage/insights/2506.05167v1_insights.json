    "ECoRAG introduces evidentiality-guided compression that filters retrieved documents based on whether they contain evidence to support answer generation, addressing the limitation of prior compression methods that don't focus on evidential information quality.",
    "The framework implements an adaptive retrieval mechanism that evaluates whether compressed content provides sufficient evidence and automatically retrieves additional documents when evidence is insufficient, ensuring answer quality is maintained.",
    "ECoRAG demonstrates superior performance on Open-Domain Question Answering tasks compared to existing compression methods while achieving significant cost efficiency through reduced token usage and latency.",
    "The system operates through a two-stage process: first compressing documents based on evidentiality scores, then validating evidence sufficiency before answer generation, making it suitable for production RAG systems.",
    "The approach addresses the fundamental trade-off between context compression and answer quality in RAG systems, providing a practical solution for handling long contexts in LLM-based question answering applications."
