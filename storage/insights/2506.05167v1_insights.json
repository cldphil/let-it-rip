    "ECoRAG introduces evidentiality-guided compression that filters retrieved documents based on whether they contain evidence to support answer generation, addressing the core limitation of prior compression methods that don't focus on evidential content.",
    "The framework implements an adaptive retrieval mechanism that evaluates whether compressed content provides sufficient evidence and automatically retrieves additional documents when needed, ensuring answer quality is maintained.",
    "ECoRAG demonstrates superior performance on Open-Domain Question Answering tasks compared to existing compression methods while achieving significant cost efficiency through reduced token usage and latency.",
    "The system operates as a preprocessing step for existing RAG pipelines, making it highly practical for integration with current LLM-based question answering systems without requiring major architectural changes.",
    "The approach addresses the critical trade-off between context compression and answer quality in RAG systems, providing a scalable solution for handling long contexts in production environments."
