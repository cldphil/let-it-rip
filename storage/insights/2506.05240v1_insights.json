    "Novel framework aligns learnable latent spaces to arbitrary target distributions using flow-based generative models as priors, eliminating computationally expensive likelihood evaluations and ODE solving during optimization.",
    "Method involves pretraining a flow model on target features to capture underlying distribution, then using this fixed flow model to regularize latent space via alignment loss that reformulates flow matching objective.",
    "Theoretical proof demonstrates that minimizing alignment loss establishes computationally tractable surrogate objective for maximizing variational lower bound on log-likelihood of latents under target distribution.",
    "Controlled experiments show alignment loss landscape closely approximates negative log-likelihood of target distribution, with validation through large-scale ImageNet image generation experiments.",
    "Framework provides both theoretical foundation and empirical validation for practical latent space alignment without expensive computational overhead of traditional flow-based methods."
