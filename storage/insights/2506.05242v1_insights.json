    "SECNEURON introduces the first framework to embed access control directly within LLM neurons through hybrid encryption, enabling reliable abuse control for locally deployed models without relying on external safeguards that can be bypassed.",
    "The framework employs task-specific neuron extraction to identify and isolate neurons responsible for specific capabilities, allowing selective encryption of sensitive functionalities while preserving other model capabilities.",
    "Neuron-level encryption with selective decryption enables dynamic control over LLM capabilities, allowing authorized users to access specific functions while preventing unauthorized task abuse in deployer-controlled environments.",
    "The approach addresses critical security gaps in local LLM deployments where traditional cloud-based mitigation techniques are ineffective, providing a cost-effective solution that operates independently of external infrastructure.",
    "SECNEURON represents a paradigm shift from external content filtering to intrinsic capability control, offering certified abuse prevention that cannot be easily circumvented through prompt engineering or model manipulation techniques."
