    "SECNEURON introduces the first framework to embed access control directly within LLM neurons through hybrid encryption, enabling reliable abuse control for locally deployed models without relying on external safeguards that can be bypassed.",
    "The framework employs task-specific neuron extraction to identify and isolate neurons responsible for specific capabilities, allowing selective encryption of sensitive functionalities while preserving other model capabilities.",
    "Neuron-level encryption with selective decryption enables dynamic control over LLM capabilities, allowing authorized users to unlock specific tasks while preventing unauthorized access to restricted functionalities.",
    "The approach addresses critical security gaps in local LLM deployments where traditional cloud-based mitigation techniques are ineffective, as local deployers have full control over the environment and can circumvent external controls.",
    "SECNEURON provides a cost-effective alternative to continuous monitoring and filtering approaches by embedding security directly into the model architecture, reducing computational overhead during inference."
