    "LLMs achieve only 26.50% average pass@1 rate on code migration tasks, with GPT-4 O performing best at 43.84%, indicating significant room for improvement in automated code migration capabilities across different environments and package versions.",
    "LLMs demonstrate better proficiency with newer function versions compared to legacy versions, making them more effective for forward migration (updating old code to new environments) than backward compatibility tasks.",
    "The benchmark identifies three critical code migration subtasks: identifying version-incompatible functions, detecting changes in function definitions between versions, and adapting code to target environments - providing a structured framework for evaluating migration capabilities.",
    "LLMs exhibit logical inconsistencies by sometimes identifying function changes that are irrelevant to the intended migration task, suggesting the need for better context understanding and relevance filtering in migration scenarios.",
    "The study establishes CODEMENV as the first comprehensive benchmark for code migration with 922 examples across 19 Python and Java packages, providing a standardized evaluation framework for future research in automated code migration tools."

  "limitations": [
    "Limited to only Python and Java packages, excluding other popular programming languages and frameworks",
    "Low overall performance rates suggest current LLMs are not yet reliable enough for production code migration without human oversight"
