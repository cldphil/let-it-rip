    "Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced and are increasingly\ncapable of tackling complex scientific problems, including those in physics.\nDespite this progress, current LLMs often fail to emulate the concise,\nprinciple-based reasoning characteristic of human experts, instead generating\nlengthy and opaque solutions. This discrepancy highlights a crucial gap in\ntheir ability to apply core physical principles for efficient and interpretable\nproblem solving. To systematically investigate this limitation, we introduce\nPhySense, a novel principle-based physics reasoning benchmark designed to be\neasily solvable by experts using guiding principles, yet deceptively difficult\nfor LLMs without principle-first reasoning.",
    "Our evaluation across multiple\nstate-of-the-art LLMs and prompt types reveals a consistent failure to align\nwith expert-like reasoning paths, providing insights for developing AI systems\nwith efficient, robust and interpretable principle-based scientific reasoning."
