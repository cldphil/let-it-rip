    "The paper introduces PhySense, a novel benchmark of 380 physics problems designed to test if large language models (LLMs) can reason using fundamental physical principles in a direct and efficient manner, similar to how human experts approach problems.",
    "Evaluations across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs revealed a consistent failure to align with expert-like reasoning paths, generating longer and more convoluted solutions instead of leveraging core principles for direct solutions.",
    "The authors argue that developing LLMs capable of principle-based reasoning, akin to how human physicists think, could lead to more interpretable, robust, and computationally efficient AI systems for scientific reasoning.",
    "PhySense problems are carefully curated to be straightforward for humans using core physics principles, but challenging for current LLMs unless they adopt principle-first reasoning approaches.",
    "In addition to accuracy, the benchmark also quantifies the reasoning cost of LLM solutions by comparing the token efficiency to principle-based expert solutions."
