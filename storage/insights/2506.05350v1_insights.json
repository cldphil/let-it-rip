    "Contrastive Flow Matching (\u2206FM) addresses flow overlap in conditional diffusion models by adding a contrastive objective that maximizes dissimilarities between predicted flows from different sample pairs, ensuring unique flows across conditions.",
    "The method significantly improves image coherence and global structure consistency in class-conditioned image generation, as demonstrated on ImageNet-1k at 512\u00d7512 resolution with visually superior results compared to baseline flow matching.",
    "\u2206FM extends standard flow matching by explicitly enforcing uniqueness across all conditional flows, solving the fundamental problem where flows from different conditions may overlap in conditional settings leading to ambiguous generations.",
    "The approach requires minimal modification to existing flow matching implementations - only adding a contrastive loss term that compares flows between arbitrary sample pairs during training without changing the base architecture.",
    "This technique represents a general improvement applicable to any conditional flow matching scenario, potentially extending beyond image generation to other domains where conditional generation suffers from flow ambiguity issues."
