    "The paper introduces a direct numerical layout generation approach for 3D indoor scene synthesis that outperforms existing methods like Holodeck, I-Design, and LayoutGPT in both instruction compliance and physical plausibility of object placement.",
    "The method addresses critical issues in existing approaches including inappropriate object placement and sizing, object omission from fine-grained user instructions, and poor spatial reasoning capabilities.",
    "The approach uses spatial reasoning to generate realistic 3D indoor scenes from natural language text descriptions, enabling more accurate interpretation of complex spatial relationships between objects.",
    "The system demonstrates superior performance in handling detailed scene descriptions with multiple objects and specific spatial constraints, such as positioning gaming chairs on specific sides of a foosball table.",
    "The research contributes to embodied AI and digital content creation by providing a more reliable method for automated 3D scene generation that better follows user specifications."
