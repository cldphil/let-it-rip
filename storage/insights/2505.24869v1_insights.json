    "Our simple, modular, and\ntraining-free video reasoning framework achieves the best-reported results on\nVideo-MME (long), Video-MMMU (comprehension), Video-MMLU, CGBench, and EgoLife.\nFurthermore, our empirical study focused on video reasoning capabilities shows\nthat, despite not being explicitly trained on video, strong reasoning LLMs can\neffectively aggregate multisensory input information from video, speech, and\naudio for complex temporal, causal, long-context, and knowledge acquisition\nreasoning tasks in video."
