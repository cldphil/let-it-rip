    "SiLVR is a simple, modular, and training-free language-based framework for complex video-language reasoning tasks that decomposes video understanding into two stages: converting raw videos into rich language-based descriptions, and then using a large language model to reason over these descriptions.",
    "SiLVR achieves strong performance on several video reasoning benchmarks like Video-MME, Video-MMMU, Video-MMLU, CGBench, and EgoLife, despite not being explicitly trained on video data.",
    "The empirical study shows that strong reasoning language models can effectively aggregate multi-sensory input information from video, speech, and audio for complex temporal, causal, long-context, and knowledge acquisition reasoning tasks in video.",
    "SiLVR does not rely on expensive chain-of-thought data or task-specific reward designs, making it more generalizable and easier to optimize compared to other multimodal reasoning approaches.",
    "The proposed approach is simpler and more modular than existing RL-based multimodal reasoning methods, which often require large amounts of resources for training and can sometimes perform worse than supervised fine-tuning approaches."
