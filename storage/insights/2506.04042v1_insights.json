    "Locate-then-edit knowledge editing methods suffer from shortcut learning where models over-learn subject features while neglecting relation features, causing uncontrolled modifications to unrelated relations connected to the target subject.",
    "The paper identifies two crucial features for knowledge editing optimization: subject features and relation features, with current methods failing to balance learning between these two components effectively.",
    "A novel two-stage optimization approach is proposed to eliminate shortcut learning by ensuring both subject and relation awareness during the knowledge editing process, improving controllability of edits.",
    "The shortcut learning issue explains why existing locate-then-edit methods tend to modify most unrelated relations connected to the subject of target editing, making them unreliable for precise knowledge updates.",
    "The research provides a theoretical framework for understanding why knowledge editing methods fail to maintain precision and offers a systematic approach to improve the controllability of factual knowledge updates in large language models."
