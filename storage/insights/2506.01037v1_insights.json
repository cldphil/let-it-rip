    "The paper introduces a novel Video State-Space block with 3D Selective Scan module that provides global spatio-temporal attention for maintaining content consistency across video frames at lower computational cost compared to traditional attention mechanisms.",
    "A self-supervised ControlNet framework is developed that uses HR features as guidance and employs contrastive learning to extract degradation-insensitive features from low-resolution videos, significantly reducing artifacts in generated high-resolution details.",
    "The integration of Mamba architecture into pre-trained latent diffusion models addresses the inherent randomness problem in existing diffusion-based video super-resolution methods, making the approach more noise-robust for real-world applications.",
    "A three-stage training strategy using a mixture of HR-LR video pairs is proposed to stabilize the video super-resolution training process, providing a systematic approach for practitioners to implement the method effectively.",
    "The framework demonstrates practical applicability for real-world video enhancement scenarios where maintaining temporal consistency and reducing artifacts are critical, particularly for content creation, video restoration, and media processing industries."
