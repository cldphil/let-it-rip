    "The research introduces 'sensitivity awareness' (SA) as a novel concept enabling LLMs to adhere to predefined access rights rules in corporate environments, moving beyond simple user clearance filtering which poses performance and privacy challenges.",
    "ACCESS DENIED INC benchmark environment was developed using a modified Adult dataset with additional corporate attributes including salary, department, supervisor names, and roles to evaluate LLM sensitivity awareness in structured data scenarios.",
    "Experimental results reveal significant variations in model behavior when managing unauthorized data requests versus legitimate queries, indicating that current LLMs struggle with enforcing access controls even in highly structured data conditions.",
    "The benchmark uses categorical and numerical attributes from corporate employee data to test whether LLMs can properly restrict information access based on user permissions, providing a standardized evaluation framework for privacy-centric AI systems.",
    "The work establishes the first foundational benchmark for sensitivity-aware language models in corporate data management, addressing the growing need for LLMs that can process various document formats while maintaining proper access restrictions."
