    "Generative AI models like GPT-4 and Gemini lack intentionality, which is a fundamental requirement for speech protection under First Amendment precedent, meaning their outputs should not be considered constitutionally protected speech.",
    "Users cannot claim First Amendment rights to receive AI-generated content if the outputs themselves are not considered speech, creating a legal framework that distinguishes between human-generated and AI-generated content.",
    "Extending First Amendment protections to AI models would undermine core purposes of free speech including promoting marketplace of ideas, facilitating self-governance, and fostering self-expression since AI lacks consciousness and intent.",
    "Granting constitutional protections to AI outputs would significantly hinder government's regulatory capacity over AI technologies, potentially preventing effective oversight of misinformation, bias, and other AI-related harms.",
    "The paper establishes a legal framework for 'GenAI exceptionalism' that would allow courts to treat AI-generated content differently from human speech, enabling more targeted regulation without constitutional barriers."
