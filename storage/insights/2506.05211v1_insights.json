    "Generative AI models like GPT-4 and Gemini lack intentionality, which is a fundamental requirement for speech protection under First Amendment precedent, creating a legal framework where AI outputs should not receive constitutional speech protections.",
    "Users cannot claim First Amendment rights to receive AI-generated content if the outputs themselves do not constitute protected speech, establishing a two-tier analysis for AI communication rights.",
    "Extending First Amendment protections to AI models would undermine core free speech purposes including marketplace of ideas, self-governance, and self-expression, as AI lacks the human agency these concepts require.",
    "Granting constitutional protections to AI outputs would significantly limit government regulatory authority over AI systems, potentially preventing effective oversight of misinformation and other AI-generated harms.",
    "The paper establishes a legal framework for 'GenAI exceptionalism' - treating AI-generated content differently from human speech in constitutional analysis, with implications for content moderation, platform liability, and AI governance policies."
