    "Self-consistency requires \u0398(1/\u2206\u00b2) samples while best-of-n only needs \u0398(1/\u2206) samples to produce correct answers, where \u2206 is the probability gap between correct and second most likely answers. This means best-of-n is significantly more sample-efficient for test-time scaling.",
    "Self-correction with verifier feedback enables Transformers to simulate online learning over a pool of experts at test time, allowing a single architecture to solve multiple tasks without prior knowledge of the specific task.",
    "The research extends Transformer representation theory from single-task to multi-task settings, proving that self-correction approaches can handle diverse tasks dynamically during inference.",
    "Test-time scaling paradigms including self-consistency, best-of-n, and self-correction can be theoretically analyzed and optimized based on the probability gap between correct and incorrect answers.",
    "Empirical validation confirms the theoretical results, showing practical effectiveness of self-correction methods and providing a foundation for choosing optimal test-time strategies based on computational constraints."
