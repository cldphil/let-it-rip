    "Interactive object-aware audio generation model successfully integrates object-centric learning into conditional latent diffusion models, enabling users to generate sounds for specific visual objects through image segmentation at test time.",
    "Multi-modal attention mechanism functionally approximates test-time segmentation masks, ensuring generated audio aligns with user-selected objects without requiring explicit masks during training.",
    "Text-image attention outperforms audio-image attention approaches, likely due to CLAP model limitations in representing overlapping audio which introduces noise and weakens audio-visual associations.",
    "Addition operations are incompatible with contrastive losses used by CLAP and CLIP models when combined with SAM-generated segmentation masks, disrupting the grounding model performance.",
    "Model demonstrates superior performance compared to baselines in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, achieving better alignment between visual objects and their corresponding generated sounds in complex multi-object scenes."
