    "Customized Curriculum Learning (CCL) framework introduces model-adaptive difficulty definition that customizes curriculum datasets based on each model's individual capabilities rather than using predefined difficulty metrics, leading to more efficient sample utilization during training.",
    "Guided Prompting technique dynamically reduces sample difficulty through strategic hints, enabling effective utilization of challenging samples that would otherwise degrade performance. This approach allows models to learn from difficult examples without being overwhelmed.",
    "CCL significantly outperforms uniform training approaches across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks in both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning paradigms, demonstrating consistent effectiveness across different training methodologies.",
    "The framework shows progressive improvement across training stages, with Qwen2.5-Math models demonstrating steady accuracy gains from Stage 1 to Stage 3 in both SFT and GRPO training configurations, indicating the effectiveness of the staged curriculum approach.",
    "The research addresses critical limitations in post-training of Large Language Models, specifically inefficient sample utilization and inflexible difficulty sample processing, providing a systematic solution for mathematical reasoning enhancement that can be applied to various LLM architectures."
