    "Study compared traditional lexicon-based tools (LIWC and Pattern) against three Dutch-specific LLMs (ChocoLlama-8B-Instruct, Reynaerde-7B-chat, and GEITje-7B-ult) for valence analysis in Flemish, using 25,000 textual responses from 102 Dutch-speaking participants with self-assessed valence ratings on a -50 to +50 scale.",
    "Research addresses the challenge of sentiment analysis in low-resource languages like Flemish (Belgian Dutch), where traditional English-based tools may not capture linguistic nuances and cultural context effectively.",
    "The study uses ecological momentary assessment methodology where participants provided daily narratives prompted by 'What is happening right now and how do you feel about it?', creating a realistic dataset of spontaneous, context-dependent language use.",
    "Three specialized Dutch LLMs were evaluated against established lexicon-based approaches, providing insights into whether modern language models can outperform traditional tools for emotion detection in low-resource language contexts.",
    "The research contributes to understanding the effectiveness of domain-specific language models versus general lexicon-based tools for psychological and computational linguistics applications in multilingual settings."
