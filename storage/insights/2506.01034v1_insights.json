    "Local intrinsic dimensions of contextual language model embeddings can predict when a model's training capabilities are exhausted, providing an early stopping criterion that could prevent overfitting and reduce computational costs during training.",
    "Reductions in mean local dimension consistently accompany and predict subsequent performance gains during fine-tuning, offering practitioners a geometric heuristic to monitor and optimize fine-tuning processes without relying solely on validation metrics.",
    "The geometric properties of latent embeddings provide insights into model training dynamics and generalization ability, enabling practitioners to understand how fine-tuning affects internal model representations beyond surface-level performance metrics.",
    "The approach was validated on practical tasks including dialogue systems, emotion recognition, and arithmetic reasoning (grokking), demonstrating broad applicability across different NLP domains and model architectures.",
    "This geometric analysis framework bridges the gap between intrinsic model mechanisms and embedding space properties, contributing to LLM interpretability and providing practitioners with tools to make informed decisions about model configuration and fine-tuning strategies."
