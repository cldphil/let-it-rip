    "Effectivity frames provide a more compact representation than concurrent game frames (CGF) for alternating-time \u03bc-calculus model checking, potentially enabling faster evaluation of coalitional modalities in multi-agent systems.",
    "The research implements a translation mechanism from concurrent game frames to effectivity frames and demonstrates practical performance analysis using a generic model checker for coalgebraic \u03bc-calculi.",
    "Performance comparison against MCMAS (state-of-the-art ATL model checker) shows that conversion overhead from CGF to effectivity frames may impact performance on large systems, requiring careful consideration of system size.",
    "The study uses both dedicated benchmark series and randomly generated systems/formulas for comprehensive evaluation, providing a robust methodology for assessing model checking performance improvements.",
    "The work contributes to advancing coalitional logic model checking by exploring alternative semantic representations that could lead to more efficient verification of multi-agent system properties."
