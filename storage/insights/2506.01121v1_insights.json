    "Neuro-Symbolic Diffusion (NSD) framework interleaves diffusion steps with symbolic optimization to generate samples that comply with user-defined functional and logic constraints, providing certifiable consistency for safety-critical applications.",
    "The framework works with both standard and discrete diffusion models, enabling generation of continuous outputs (images, trajectories) and discrete outputs (molecular structures, natural language) that satisfy constraints simultaneously.",
    "NSD addresses three key application areas: safety (non-toxic molecular generation and collision-free trajectory planning), physical grounding (constraint-compliant generation), and robustness in generation processes.",
    "The approach combines neural generative capabilities of diffusion models with symbolic reasoning and optimization, creating a hybrid system that maintains both creativity and constraint satisfaction.",
    "This represents the first framework to enable constraint-compliant generation across both continuous and discrete domains within a unified diffusion-based approach, opening new possibilities for scientific and safety-critical AI applications."
