    "CoVoMix2 introduces a fully non-autoregressive framework that directly predicts mel-spectrograms from multi-stream transcriptions using flow-matching-based generative models, eliminating the need for intermediate token representations and improving inference speed over autoregressive approaches.",
    "The system implements three key strategies for realistic conversational dynamics: transcription-level speaker disentanglement to maintain speaker consistency, sentence-level alignment for coherent dialogue flow, and prompt-level random masking to improve generalization in zero-shot scenarios.",
    "CoVoMix2 achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to strong baselines like MoonCast and Sesame across multiple metrics including speech quality, speaker consistency, and inference speed, while supporting controllable dialogue generation with overlapping speech and precise timing control.",
    "The framework operates without requiring transcriptions for the prompt, enabling true zero-shot multi-talker dialogue generation, which significantly reduces the data preparation overhead and makes the system more practical for real-world deployment.",
    "The approach addresses critical challenges in conversational AI including maintaining speaker consistency across long dialogues, modeling realistic overlapping speech patterns, and synthesizing coherent multi-speaker conversations efficiently for applications in podcast creation, virtual agents, and multimedia content generation."
