    "Future discriminators technique dramatically improved text comprehensibility for beginner language learners from 40.4% to 84.3%, demonstrating that modular controllable generation methods can effectively adapt LLM outputs without requiring model fine-tuning.",
    "Simple prompting alone fails to control output difficulty for language learning applications, indicating that more sophisticated controllable generation techniques are necessary for educational AI systems targeting beginner learners.",
    "Token Miss Rate (TMR) was introduced as a novel token-level evaluation metric that quantifies the proportion of incomprehensible tokens per utterance and shows strong correlation with human judgments, providing a practical assessment tool for language learning applications.",
    "The research specifically targets CEFR A1-A2 level learners (absolute beginners) and demonstrates that standard LLMs generate text at near-native complexity levels, making them unsuitable for beginner language learning without difficulty control mechanisms.",
    "The study provides comprehensive evaluation through both automatic metrics and user studies with university-level Japanese learners, establishing a robust methodology for assessing AI-assisted language learning tools and releasing code, models, annotation tools, and datasets for future research."

  "limitations": [
    "The study focuses specifically on Japanese language learning, which may limit generalizability to other languages with different linguistic structures",
