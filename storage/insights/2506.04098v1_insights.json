    "TextAtari benchmark successfully converts visual Atari games into textual representations using AtariARI framework, enabling language agents to play games through text descriptions spanning up to 100,000 steps, creating a novel testbed for long-horizon decision-making.",
    "Three distinct evaluation frameworks were implemented: zero-shot (basic prompting), few-shot chain-of-thought (with reasoning examples), and reference-based (using PPO expert demonstrations sampled every 10th state-action pair) to assess language model performance on sequential decision-making tasks.",
    "The benchmark encompasses nearly 100 distinct tasks with varying complexity levels, action spaces, and planning horizons, providing comprehensive evaluation across different game mechanics, strategic considerations, and win conditions to test language agents' adaptability.",
    "Reference-based approach leverages expert demonstrations from trained PPO agents achieving human-level performance, formatted as state-action sequences to provide concrete examples of successful gameplay strategies for language models to learn from.",
    "The research bridges natural language processing with sequential decision-making by translating visual game states into rich textual descriptions, opening new possibilities for applying language models to complex multi-step reasoning and planning tasks in interactive environments."
