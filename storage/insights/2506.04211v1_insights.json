    "The Diffusion Domain Teacher (DDT) method achieves significant performance improvements in cross-domain object detection, with an average improvement of 21.2% mAP compared to baseline methods and surpassing current state-of-the-art methods by an average of 5.7% mAP across six datasets.",
    "The approach leverages frozen-weight diffusion models as feature extractors to bridge domain gaps between training data (source domain) and real-world deployment data (target domain), utilizing the cross-domain representation capabilities of diffusion models without requiring model retraining.",
    "The method employs a teacher-student framework where a diffusion-based detector trained on source domain generates pseudo labels for unlabeled target domain data, which then guides supervised learning of a student model on the target domain, enabling effective knowledge transfer.",
    "The solution maintains inference speed without compromise while achieving substantial performance gains, making it practically viable for real-world deployment scenarios where computational efficiency is critical alongside accuracy improvements.",
    "The framework demonstrates consistent performance improvements across multiple detector architectures and datasets, indicating broad applicability and robustness of the diffusion-guided domain adaptation approach for various object detection scenarios."
