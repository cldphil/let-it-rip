    "The paper introduces TalkingHeadBench, the first manually curated, multi-generator, multi-modal benchmark designed specifically for evaluating detector robustness against state-of-the-art talking-head deepfakes.",
    "The benchmark features high-quality synthetic videos generated using six academic and one commercial talking-head generator using both audio and video-driven diffusion and transformer-based models.",
    "The authors carefully design evaluation protocols to assess the generalization and robustness of state-of-the-art (SOTA) deepfake detectors across identity and generator shifts in training and testing data.",
    "The paper presents a detailed error analysis using Grad-CAM to identify common failure cases of SOTA detectors on different generators and inform future improvements in detection strategies.",
    "The TalkingHeadBench benchmark is hosted on HuggingFace, providing train-test data for all generators across multiple protocols to accelerate research towards more robust and generalizable detection models."
