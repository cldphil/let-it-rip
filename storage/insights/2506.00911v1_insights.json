    "Conformal Arbitrage introduces a post-hoc framework that balances competing objectives in language models by learning data-driven thresholds between a Primary model and Guardian model, providing finite-sample, distribution-free guarantees that undesirable events stay below user-specified quotas.",
    "The framework operates entirely at the API level without requiring access to model logits or weight updates, making it compatible with existing cost-aware cascades and complementary to weight-based alignment techniques for seamless integration.",
    "The method uses conformal risk control to calibrate thresholds, ensuring mathematical guarantees that long-run frequency of safety violations, factual errors, or other undesirable events does not exceed predetermined limits.",
    "Conformal Arbitrage traces an efficient frontier allowing users to define acceptable performance levels for one objective while maximizing utility in another, demonstrated through empirical evaluation showing accuracy improvements over baseline approaches.",
    "The Guardian component can be either another language model or a human domain expert, providing flexibility in implementation and allowing organizations to incorporate human oversight into automated decision-making processes."
