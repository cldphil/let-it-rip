    "SEALQA benchmark reveals that even frontier LLMs like O3 and O4-MINI achieve only 17.1% and 6.3% accuracy respectively on challenging search-augmented reasoning tasks, indicating significant gaps in current AI capabilities for handling conflicting or noisy web search results.",
    "Advanced reasoning models including DEEPSEEK-R1-671B and O3-MINI are highly vulnerable to noisy search results, suggesting that current search-augmented generation systems lack robust filtering and verification mechanisms for handling unreliable information sources.",
    "Increasing test-time compute does not yield reliable performance gains across O3-MINI, O4-MINI, and O3 models, with performance often plateauing or declining early, indicating that computational scaling alone is insufficient for improving reasoning with conflicting information.",
    "The benchmark introduces three evaluation flavors: SEAL-0 for most challenging questions with near-zero baseline accuracy, SEAL-HARD for general factual accuracy assessment, and LONG SEAL for multi-document needle-in-haystack reasoning scenarios, providing comprehensive evaluation framework for search-augmented systems.",
    "While recent models show improvement on the 'lost-in-the-middle' problem for long-context reasoning, they still fail at fundamental reasoning tasks when dealing with conflicting information, highlighting the need for better information synthesis and conflict resolution mechanisms in RAG systems."
