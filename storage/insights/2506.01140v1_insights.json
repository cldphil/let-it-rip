    "ReTern technique achieves 35% reduction in perplexity on Wikitext dataset for BitNet b1.58 700M and 3B ternary LLMs by combining fault-aware sign transformations (FAST) with TCiM bit-cell reprogramming, demonstrating significant fault tolerance improvement in compute-in-memory accelerators.",
    "Ternary LLMs using ternary precision weights and 8-bit activations provide competitive performance while significantly reducing computational and memory requirements compared to full-precision LLMs, making them practical for resource-constrained deployments.",
    "The dual-approach methodology uses FAST to minimize computation errors in +1/-1 weights while exploiting natural bit-cell redundancy to target stuck-at faults (SAFs) in zero weights through zero-fix technique, addressing different fault types with specialized solutions.",
    "Ternary computing-in-memory (TCiM) accelerators can alleviate the von-Neumann bottleneck for LLM deployment but are particularly vulnerable to memory stuck-at faults due to LLMs' low weight sparsity, requiring specialized fault tolerance mechanisms.",
    "The research demonstrates that hardware-software co-design approaches can effectively address reliability challenges in emerging computing paradigms, with implications for deploying quantized neural networks on fault-prone but energy-efficient accelerators."
