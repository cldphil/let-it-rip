    "The paper introduces a quantization-based approach that provides strict upper and lower bounds for the Wasserstein metric, achieving 10\u00d7-100\u00d7 speedup compared to entropy-regularized optimal transport while maintaining approximation error below 2%.",
    "The methodology involves solving a Kantorovich problem on a coarse grid using quantized measures and specially designed cost matrices, followed by upscaling and correction stages in either primal or dual space.",
    "The approach specifically targets discrete measures on regular grids, making it particularly suitable for image-based applications and structured data where grid representations are natural.",
    "Unlike existing approximation methods that trade accuracy for speed without guarantees, this method provides mathematically rigorous bounds while maintaining computational efficiency, offering both theoretical guarantees and practical performance.",
    "Evaluation on the DOTmark optimal transport benchmark demonstrates the method's effectiveness for image processing tasks, suggesting broad applicability to computer vision and generative modeling applications."
