    "VideoMarathon dataset contains 9,700 hours of long videos (3-60 minutes each) with 3.3M high-quality QA pairs across 6 fundamental topics (temporality, spatiality, object, action, scene, event), representing the first large-scale hour-long video instruction-following dataset for training video language models.",
    "Hour-LLaVA model processes hour-long videos at 1 FPS during both training and inference using a Memory Augmentation (MemAug) mechanism that adaptively integrates question-relevant and spatiotemporal-informative semantics from cached information to maintain long-term dependencies.",
    "The MemAug mechanism provides learnable compression directly supervised by next-token prediction loss, outperforming explicit token compression methods that rely on hand-crafted heuristics, effectively mitigating information loss from sparse sampling in long videos.",
    "The approach supports 22 diverse tasks requiring both short- and long-term video comprehension, significantly extending training video durations up to 1 hour compared to existing video instruction datasets which focus on shorter clips.",
    "Training on VideoMarathon achieved best performance results, demonstrating that large-scale hour-long video training can unlock new capabilities in video-language understanding models for practical applications requiring extended temporal reasoning."
