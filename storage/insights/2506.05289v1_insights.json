    "AliTok introduces a novel aligned tokenizer that uses causal decoders to establish unidirectional dependencies among encoded tokens, directly addressing the mismatch between bidirectional tokenizer encoding and autoregressive model requirements in image generation.",
    "The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-256 with gFID score of 1.50 using only 177M parameters and 1.35 with 662M parameters, while providing 10x faster sampling speed compared to diffusion methods.",
    "Two-stage tokenizer training combined with prefix tokens significantly enhances reconstruction consistency while maintaining generation-friendly properties, solving the traditional trade-off between reconstruction quality and autoregressive modeling effectiveness.",
    "The approach uses standard decoder-only autoregressive models as generators, making it compatible with existing transformer architectures and requiring no specialized model designs or complex training procedures.",
    "AliTok demonstrates that alignment between tokenizer and generator modeling approaches is crucial for autoregressive image generation, opening new research directions for improving sequence modeling consistency across the generation pipeline."
