    "AliTok introduces a novel aligned tokenizer that uses causal decoders to establish unidirectional dependencies among encoded tokens, directly addressing the mismatch between bidirectional tokenizer encoding and autoregressive model requirements in image generation.",
    "The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-256 with gFID score of 1.35 using a 662M parameter model, and 1.50 gFID with IS of 305.9 using only 177M parameters, demonstrating significant efficiency gains over existing approaches.",
    "Two-stage tokenizer training combined with prefix tokens enhances reconstruction consistency while maintaining generation-friendly properties, solving the traditional trade-off between reconstruction quality and autoregressive modeling effectiveness.",
    "The approach provides 10x faster sampling speed compared to state-of-the-art diffusion methods while achieving superior quality metrics, making it highly practical for real-time applications requiring high-quality image generation.",
    "The alignment between tokenizer and autoregressive model architectures represents a fundamental shift in approach that could be applied beyond image generation to other sequence modeling tasks, establishing a new paradigm for autoregressive generation systems."
