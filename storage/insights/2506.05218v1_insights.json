    "MonkeyOCR introduces a Structure-Recognition-Relation (SRR) triplet paradigm that decomposes document parsing into three fundamental questions: 'Where is it?' (structure/layout analysis), 'What is it?' (recognition/content identification), and 'How is it organized?' (relation/logical ordering), providing a more systematic approach than existing multi-tool pipelines.",
    "The SRR approach achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models on OmniDocBench across nine different document types, demonstrating the effectiveness of the focused decomposition strategy over both modular approaches like MinerU and large end-to-end multimodal LLMs like Qwen-VL.",
    "The research introduces MonkeyDoc, the most comprehensive document parsing dataset to date with 3.9 million instances spanning over ten document types, providing a substantial training resource that enables better generalization across diverse document formats and structures.",
    "The SRR paradigm balances accuracy and speed by avoiding the inefficiencies of processing full pages with giant end-to-end models while maintaining precision through focused task decomposition, making it more scalable for practical deployment scenarios.",
    "The vision-language model architecture simplifies what would otherwise require complex multi-tool pipelines, reducing system complexity and potential failure points while maintaining high performance across diverse document parsing tasks."
