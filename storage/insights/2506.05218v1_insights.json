    "MonkeyOCR introduces a Structure-Recognition-Relation (SRR) triplet paradigm that decomposes document parsing into three fundamental questions: 'Where is it?' (structure/layout analysis), 'What is it?' (recognition/content identification), and 'How is it organized?' (relation/logical ordering), providing a more systematic approach than existing multi-tool pipelines.",
    "The SRR approach achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models on OmniDocBench across nine different document types, demonstrating the effectiveness of the focused decomposition strategy over both modular approaches like MinerU and large end-to-end multimodal LLMs like Qwen-VL.",
    "The research introduces MonkeyDoc, the most comprehensive document parsing dataset to date with 3.9 million instances spanning over ten document types, providing a substantial training resource that enables better generalization across diverse document formats and structures.",
    "The vision-language model design balances accuracy and speed by avoiding the inefficiencies of processing full pages with giant end-to-end models while maintaining precision through the structured triplet approach, making it more scalable for practical deployment scenarios.",
    "The SRR paradigm simplifies what would otherwise require complex multi-tool pipelines, reducing implementation complexity and potentially lowering the barrier to entry for organizations looking to implement robust document parsing solutions across various document types and formats."
