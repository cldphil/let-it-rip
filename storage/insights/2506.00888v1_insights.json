    "The integrated LEED certification platform achieved 82% automation coverage and up to 70% reduction in documentation time compared to traditional manual workflows, demonstrating significant efficiency gains through computer vision and LLM-RAG integration.",
    "The system uses OpenCV-based preprocessing pipeline for document analysis combined with PySide6 user interface, Review Manager for process orchestration, and multiple analysis engines including EnergyPlus for energy modeling and location-based evaluation.",
    "A novel metadata-aligned chunking strategy segments LEED documentation by credit unit (e.g., 'EA Credit: Optimize Energy Performance') rather than naive sentence-level splits, aligning with the inherent structure of LEED reference materials for improved retrieval accuracy.",
    "The platform operates entirely on local infrastructure using Gemma3 large language model with RAG framework, ensuring data privacy and reducing operational costs while maintaining FAISS vector indexing for efficient approximate nearest neighbor search.",
    "Each document chunk is tagged with comprehensive metadata including credit category, name, point value, and type (Prerequisite or Credit), enabling structured retrieval and contextually relevant report generation for green building certification automation."
