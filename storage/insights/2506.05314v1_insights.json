    "Introduces a novel constrained optimization formulation for LLM unlearning that separates forgetting and retention objectives, avoiding the instability issues of traditional scalarized loss approaches that combine both objectives into a single loss function.",
    "Develops a logit-margin flattening loss that is softmax-free, numerically stable, and maintains non-vanishing gradients, providing more efficient optimization compared to entropy-based objectives that suffer from vanishing gradients during aggressive forgetting.",
    "Implements a scalable primal-dual algorithm that explicitly exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through dual variable dynamics, enabling better control over the unlearning process compared to regularized approaches.",
    "Demonstrates consistent performance improvements on TOFU and MUSE benchmarks across diverse LLM architectures, showing the method's generalizability and robustness in real-world unlearning scenarios.",
    "Addresses critical industry need for removing sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information from deployed LLMs while maintaining performance on retained knowledge, with Amazon's involvement suggesting enterprise-scale validation."
