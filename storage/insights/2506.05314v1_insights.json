    "Proposed constrained entropic unlearning framework reformulates LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem, separating forgetting objectives from retention constraints rather than combining them in a single scalarized loss, leading to more stable optimization.",
    "Introduced novel logit-margin flattening loss that drives output distribution toward uniformity on forget sets without using softmax operations, providing numerical stability and maintaining non-vanishing gradients for more efficient optimization compared to entropy-based methods.",
    "Developed scalable primal-dual algorithm that explicitly exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through dual variable dynamics, enabling better control over the unlearning process and preventing degraded performance on retained data.",
    "Demonstrated consistent performance improvements on TOFU and MUSE benchmarks across diverse LLM architectures, showing the framework's generalizability and effectiveness in real-world unlearning scenarios involving sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information.",
    "Addressed critical deployment challenge for LLMs in production environments where unlearning capabilities are essential for compliance, privacy, and data governance requirements, providing a more robust alternative to existing regularized trade-off approaches."
