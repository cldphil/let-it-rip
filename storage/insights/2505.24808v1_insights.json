    "The proposed RealDrive approach is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that initializes a diffusion-based driving policy by retrieving the most relevant expert demonstrations from the training dataset.",
    "By interpolating between current observations and retrieved examples through a denoising process, RealDrive enables fine-grained control and safe behavior across diverse scenarios, leveraging the strong prior provided by the retrieved scenario.",
    "A key insight is that a task-relevant retrieval model trained with planning-based objectives results in superior planning performance compared to a task-agnostic retriever.",
    "Experimental results on the Waymo Open Motion dataset demonstrate a 40% reduction in collision rate and improved generalization to long-tail events and trajectory diversity compared to standard learning-based planners.",
    "The retrieval-augmented approach addresses the limitations of learning-based planners in generalizing to under-represented scenarios and offering limited controllability over the generated trajectories."
