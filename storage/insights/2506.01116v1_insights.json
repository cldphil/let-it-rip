    "ChemAU framework introduces adaptive uncertainty estimation specifically designed for chemistry problems, addressing the significant performance gap when general LLMs are applied to chemical research tasks involving complex terminology and specialized symbol systems.",
    "The framework tackles the hallucination problem in LLMs when processing chemistry-related content by incorporating domain-specific knowledge and chemical formulas through a novel uncertainty estimation approach that can identify specific problematic reasoning steps.",
    "Unlike existing uncertainty estimation methods that provide general assessments, ChemAU applies different uncertainty measures to precisely pinpoint key knowledge gaps and specific steps in chemical reasoning processes.",
    "The system is designed to handle the unique challenges of chemistry problems including long complex reasoning chains, specialized nomenclature conventions, and domain-specific symbol systems that cause standard LLMs to fail.",
    "The research addresses a critical gap in applying LLMs to scientific domains, particularly chemistry, where existing methods struggle to effectively leverage chemical expertise and formulas for accurate reasoning."
