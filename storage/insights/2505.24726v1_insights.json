    "By incentivizing the model\nto generate better self-reflections when it answers incorrectly, we demonstrate\nthat a model's ability to solve complex, verifiable tasks can be enhanced even\nwhen generating synthetic data is infeasible and only binary feedback is\navailable.",
    "Our experimental\nresults show substantial performance gains across a variety of model\narchitectures, as high as 34.7% improvement at math equation writing and 18.1%\nimprovement at function calling.",
    "Our novel paradigm is thus an exciting pathway to more useful\nand reliable language models that can self-improve on challenging tasks with\nlimited external feedback."
