    "The researchers applied a semi-supervised, taxonomy-driven approach to classify Ethereum input data messages (IDMs) into topics, using a predefined set of main topics and subtopics based on domain knowledge and initial data exploration.",
    "A large language model (GPT-4o) was utilized to map each IDM to the most suitable main-subtopic pair, with human review and iterative prompting adjustments to refine the model outputs and ensure consistent labeling quality.",
    "The resulting topic taxonomy covers 12 main topics with 48 subtopics, with English IDMs more concentrated in Security & Incidents (24%) and Chinese IDMs more prevalent in Social & Emotional Expression (44%).",
    "English IDM senders are more likely to use messages for warnings about scams, project promotion, and financial assistance requests, while Chinese IDM senders often use messages for social connection, emotional expression, and copyright claims.",
    "The study highlights the diverse communicative purposes of the Ethereum transaction layer beyond just P2P transfers, functioning as both a transactional tool and a decentralized communication channel."
