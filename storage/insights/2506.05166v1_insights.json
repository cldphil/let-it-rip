    "Bias-related computations in LLMs are highly localized and concentrated in a small subset of layers, enabling targeted interventions. Mechanistic interpretability techniques can identify specific internal edges responsible for biased behavior across models like GPT-2 and Llama2.",
    "Removing bias-responsible components reduces biased outputs by 19.86% to 71.30% across different bias types (demographic and gender), but creates trade-offs with other NLP tasks like named entity recognition (0.01% to 20.40% performance drop) and linguistic acceptability judgment (0.01% to 22.6% performance drop).",
    "Bias components exhibit instability across fine-tuning settings, changing even during training unrelated to bias correction. This suggests that bias mitigation strategies need to be continuously monitored and adjusted throughout the model lifecycle.",
    "The research demonstrates that bias-related edges overlap with components responsible for other language understanding tasks, indicating a hierarchical organization of linguistic knowledge where certain capabilities are deeply integrated into high-influential network edges.",
    "Systematic ablation studies reveal that bias mitigation approaches must balance bias reduction with preservation of general language capabilities, as complete removal of bias-related components significantly impacts model performance on standard NLP benchmarks."
