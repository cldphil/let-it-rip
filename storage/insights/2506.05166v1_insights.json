    "Bias-related computations in LLMs are highly localized and concentrated in a small subset of layers, enabling targeted interventions. Mechanistic interpretability techniques can identify specific internal edges responsible for biased behavior across models like GPT-2 and Llama2.",
    "Removing bias-responsible components reduces biased outputs by 19.86% to 71.30% across different bias types (demographic and gender), but creates trade-offs with other NLP tasks like named entity recognition (0.01% to 20.40% performance drop) and linguistic acceptability judgment (0.01% to 22.6% performance drop).",
    "Bias components exhibit instability across fine-tuning settings, changing even during training unrelated to bias correction. This suggests that bias mitigation strategies need to be continuously monitored and adjusted throughout model development lifecycle.",
    "The research demonstrates that bias-related edges overlap significantly with components responsible for general language understanding tasks, indicating a hierarchical organization of linguistic knowledge where certain capabilities are deeply integrated into high-influential network edges.",
    "Systematic ablation studies reveal that bias mitigation cannot be achieved without affecting other model capabilities, requiring practitioners to balance bias reduction against task performance degradation when deploying LLMs in production environments."
