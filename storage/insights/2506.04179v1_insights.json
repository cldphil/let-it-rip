    "SkipGPT achieves over 40% model parameter reduction while maintaining or exceeding performance through dynamic layer pruning that considers token-level heterogeneity and component-specific pruning policies for MLP and self-attention layers.",
    "The framework introduces global token-aware routing that prioritizes critical tokens based on cosine similarity analysis, showing significant variation in module importance across different tokens (ranging from 0.00 to 1.00 in the LLaMA-2-7B case study).",
    "A two-stage optimization paradigm mitigates training instability: first using disentangled training with soft parameterization to learn routing strategies, followed by parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning to restore performance after layer removal.",
    "The method addresses both horizontal dynamics (token-level heterogeneity requiring context-aware decisions) and vertical dynamics (distinct functional roles of MLP vs self-attention layers requiring component-specific policies).",
    "Case study analysis on BookCorpus dataset with LLaMA-2-7B demonstrates that module importance varies significantly across tokens and layers, with some modules showing near-zero importance (0.00-0.12) while others remain critical (0.95-1.00)."
