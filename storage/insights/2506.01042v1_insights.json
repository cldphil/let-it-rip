    "Graph probing method enables prediction of next-token performance using only neural topology patterns, providing a new approach to understand LLM internal mechanisms without requiring semantic analysis of individual neurons.",
    "Neural topology patterns are extremely sparse yet predictive - retaining just 1% of neuron connections is sufficient to maintain predictive power for language generation performance, suggesting efficient pruning strategies for model optimization.",
    "Topological patterns emerge very early in training - predictive neural connectivity structures can be detected after only 8 pretraining steps, enabling early assessment of model quality and potential training efficiency improvements.",
    "Different LLM families develop consistent neural topological structures despite varying architectures, parameters, and training data, suggesting universal principles that could guide architecture design and transfer learning approaches.",
    "The method bridges neuroscience concepts with LLM analysis by focusing on functional connectivity rather than static representations, opening new research directions for understanding emergent capabilities and safer AI development."
