    "Data contamination in LLM evaluation occurs when models memorize benchmark data during training, leading to overestimated performance due to parameters acquiring shortcut solutions rather than genuine understanding.",
    "Shortcut neurons can be identified through comparative analysis between contaminated and clean models, combined with causal analysis to determine which neurons contribute to contamination-based performance gains.",
    "Shortcut neuron patching method effectively suppresses contamination effects by selectively disabling identified shortcut neurons during evaluation, providing more trustworthy performance assessment without requiring new benchmarks.",
    "The approach offers a cost-effective alternative to continuously building new benchmarks, as it analyzes contamination mechanisms within existing models rather than creating dynamic evaluation datasets.",
    "This neuron-level analysis provides insights into how LLMs encode and utilize memorized information, contributing to better understanding of model interpretability and evaluation reliability in production environments."
