    "The framework achieves exceptional performance with 98.2% F1-score, 97.8% precision, and 97.0% recall in real-time transaction monitoring by combining graph neural networks with generative AI for compliance explanation.",
    "Dynamic transaction graphs are constructed to extract both structural and contextual features, enabling the system to identify suspicious behavior patterns that traditional rule-based systems might miss.",
    "A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module generates natural-language explanations aligned with specific regulatory clauses for each flagged transaction, making compliance decisions audit-ready and interpretable.",
    "The system integrates narrative field embedding to process unstructured transaction data alongside graph-based structural analysis, providing comprehensive transaction context for better decision-making.",
    "Expert evaluation confirms the quality and interpretability of generated justifications, demonstrating practical viability for high-risk financial environments where explainable AI is crucial for regulatory compliance."
