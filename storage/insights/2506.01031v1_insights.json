    "NavBench introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in embodied navigation tasks, featuring 3,200 question-answer pairs across four task types: step-by-step navigation execution, temporal progress estimation, global instruction alignment, and local observation-action reasoning.",
    "GPT-4o demonstrates superior performance across all navigation tasks compared to other models, while lighter open-source models show competency only in simpler navigation scenarios, indicating a clear performance hierarchy based on model complexity and training.",
    "Models with higher comprehension scores in understanding navigation behavior and spatial reasoning consistently achieve better execution performance in actual navigation tasks, establishing a strong correlation between comprehension abilities and practical navigation success.",
    "Providing map-based context significantly improves decision accuracy in navigation tasks, particularly in medium-difficulty scenarios, suggesting that supplementary spatial information enhances MLLM navigation capabilities beyond pure visual input.",
    "Most MLLMs struggle significantly with temporal understanding and progress estimation during navigation sequences, representing a critical limitation that could impact real-world deployment in dynamic environments where progress tracking is essential."
