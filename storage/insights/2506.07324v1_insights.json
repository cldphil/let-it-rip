    "DEF introduces a conditional diffusion model approach that can transform any deterministic neural weather forecasting system into a stochastic ensemble system, eliminating the need for case-by-case development of uncertainty quantification methods in machine learning weather prediction.",
    "The method generates meaningful structured perturbations for initial conditions that can be applied iteratively, addressing limitations of traditional numerical weather prediction perturbation techniques when applied to neural forecasting models.",
    "DEF incorporates a guidance term that allows intuitive control over perturbation levels, enabling users to directly regulate uncertainty quantification strength and control exploration of the atmospheric state space. This provides practitioners with fine-grained control over forecast uncertainty without requiring domain-specific perturbation design.",
    "The approach was validated on the 5.625\u00b0 ERA5 reanalysis dataset covering atmospheric and surface variables, demonstrating that stochastic extended systems accumulate less error over long-term forecasts while producing meaningful forecast distributions. The method shows practical applicability to real-world weather data at operational resolutions, though specific quantitative improvements are not detailed in the provided excerpt. Implementation requires training a conditional diffusion model alongside the base forecasting system.",
    "This work addresses the growing need for uncertainty quantification in machine learning weather prediction, offering a generalizable solution that could accelerate adoption of neural weather models in operational forecasting where ensemble predictions are critical."
