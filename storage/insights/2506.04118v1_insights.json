    "Guided Speculative Inference (GSI) combines soft best-of-n test-time scaling with reward models and speculative sampling from smaller auxiliary models to efficiently approximate optimal reward-guided decoding policies in large language models.",
    "GSI achieves higher accuracy than standard soft best-of-n approaches on mathematical reasoning benchmarks (MATH500, OlympiadBench, Minerva Math) while using computationally cheaper auxiliary models for speculation.",
    "The method provides theoretical guarantees by deriving bounds on KL divergence between the induced distribution and optimal tilted policy \u03c0\u03b2,B(y|x)\u221d\u03c0B(y|x)exp(\u03b2 r(x, y)), ensuring principled approximation quality.",
    "GSI outperforms reward-guided speculative decoding baselines and in certain settings even surpasses soft best-of-n with the primary model \u03c0B, demonstrating both efficiency and effectiveness gains.",
    "The approach addresses the computational cost problem of scaling large language models by enabling test-time alignment through efficient reward-guided generation without requiring full model scaling."
