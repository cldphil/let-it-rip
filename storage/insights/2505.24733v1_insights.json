    "DreamDance reformulates the character art animation task into two inpainting-based steps: Camera-aware Scene Inpainting for stable scene reconstruction and Pose-aware Video Inpainting for dynamic character animation.",
    "Camera-aware Scene Inpainting leverages a pre-trained image inpainting model to generate multi-view images and construct a large-scale 3D Gaussian field from the reference character art, utilizing both a pre-defined spiral camera trajectory and an extracted custom camera trajectory.",
    "A coarse background video is rendered along the custom trajectory by splatting the stable Gaussian field, providing consistent scene motion information as a foundation for the character animation stage.",
    "Pose-aware Video Inpainting injects dynamic character animation into the coarse background video by inpainting the character regions with pose guidance from the driving video.",
    "The two-stage inpainting approach produces consistent, high-quality animation sequences from the reference character art and driving videos, addressing the temporal jitter and scene distortion issues faced by previous 3D-agnostic methods."
