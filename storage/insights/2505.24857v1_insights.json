    "The paper proposes an Entropy Bounded (EB) Sampler, an adaptive sampling approach for Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) that accelerates sampling by 2-3x on coding and math reasoning benchmarks without loss in performance compared to existing samplers.",
    "EB-Sampler is formulated as part of a broad family of adaptive samplers, and the paper provides an error analysis that motivates the algorithmic choices made in the design of EB-Sampler.",
    "The proposed approach leverages the masked modeling paradigm used in MDMs, where tokens are iteratively unmasked in a specific order, deviating from the random order used during training.",
    "Recent large MDMs like LLaDa and Dream have shown competitive performance compared to similarly sized autoregressive models on language tasks by unmasking tokens in a favorable order dictated by model predictions.",
    "The EB-Sampler approach is also validated on smaller reasoning tasks like maze navigation and Sudoku, which are often challenging for autoregressive models."
