    "The paper proposes an Entropy Bounded (EB) Sampler, an adaptive sampling approach for Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) that accelerates sampling by 2-3x on coding and math reasoning benchmarks without loss in performance compared to existing samplers.",
    "MDMs sample fixed-length sequences as discrete tokens from a vocabulary, starting from a sequence of mask tokens and iteratively updating tokens until all tokens are unmasked. The EB-Sampler determines an efficient order for unmasking tokens based on model predictions and entropy bounds.",
    "The EB-Sampler formulates the sampling process as an optimization problem with an approximate error tolerance, providing an error analysis that motivates the algorithmic choices.",
    "The proposed approach is validated not only on large MDMs like LLaDa and Dream, but also on smaller reasoning tasks like maze navigation and Sudoku, where autoregressive models often struggle.",
    "The EB-Sampler represents a broad family of adaptive samplers for MDMs, offering a potential alternative to autoregressive generation for language tasks."
