    "FLEx framework enables efficient federated learning for Mixture of Experts (MoE) large language models by pruning global MoE models to keep only one expert per client, significantly reducing communication overhead compared to treating MoE as dense networks.",
    "The proposed adaptive gating mechanism allows personalized experts to be reintegrated into pre-trained MoE layers while preserving the original backbone architecture, enabling task-specific personalization without structural modifications.",
    "Current federated learning approaches fail to exploit the inherent sparsity in MoE architectures, leading to excessive communication costs and computational overhead when applied directly to sparse expert models.",
    "The framework addresses the fundamental mismatch between sparse MoE architectures and dense model-focused federated learning by designing FL protocols specifically tailored for expert-based models.",
    "This approach opens new possibilities for personalized knowledge sharing in federated settings while maintaining the scalability benefits of MoE architectures for large language models."
