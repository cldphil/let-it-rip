    "Video Frame Interpolation has evolved through multiple paradigms from classical motion compensation to modern deep learning approaches, with 8 distinct methodological categories: kernel-based, flow-based, hybrid, phase-based, GAN-based, Transformer-based, Mamba-based, and diffusion model-based approaches, providing practitioners with diverse technical options based on specific use case requirements.",
    "Two primary learning paradigms exist for VFI implementation: Center-Time Frame Interpolation (CTFI) for fixed temporal positioning and Arbitrary-Time Frame Interpolation (ATFI) for flexible temporal control, allowing developers to choose based on whether they need fixed or variable frame timing control in their applications.",
    "Four critical technical challenges consistently impact VFI performance: large motion handling, occlusion management, lighting variation adaptation, and non-linear motion processing, requiring specific architectural considerations and preprocessing strategies when implementing VFI systems in production environments.",
    "The survey covers over 250 research papers and provides standardized evaluation frameworks including established datasets, loss functions, and metrics, offering practitioners comprehensive benchmarking resources and implementation guidelines for comparing different VFI approaches in their specific domains.",
    "Specialized VFI applications have emerged for event-based cameras, cartoon animation, and medical imaging, with joint optimization approaches combining VFI with other low-level vision tasks, indicating opportunities for domain-specific implementations and multi-task learning architectures in production systems."
