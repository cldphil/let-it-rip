    "TIC-FT introduces a novel temporal concatenation approach that combines condition and target frames along the temporal axis with intermediate buffer frames containing progressively increasing noise levels, enabling smooth transitions without architectural modifications to pretrained video diffusion models.",
    "The method achieves strong performance with extremely limited training data, requiring only 10-30 training samples for effective fine-tuning, making it highly practical for scenarios with limited computational resources and small datasets.",
    "TIC-FT demonstrates versatility across multiple conditional video generation tasks including image-to-video and video-to-video generation, successfully adapting large-scale base models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan-14B without external encoders or architectural changes.",
    "The buffer frame mechanism aligns the fine-tuning process with pretrained model's temporal dynamics, overcoming limitations of existing methods that are restricted to spatially aligned conditioning and require large datasets for training.",
    "Experimental validation shows TIC-FT outperforms existing baselines in both condition fidelity and visual quality, providing a scalable solution for controllable video generation that maintains the temporal coherence of pretrained models while enabling diverse conditional control."
