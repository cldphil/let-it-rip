    "FlowMo introduces a variance-based flow guidance method that operates at inference-time to enhance temporal coherence in text-to-video generation without requiring additional training or external conditioning signals, making it immediately applicable to existing models.",
    "The method successfully mitigates severe temporal artifacts including additional limbs appearing on subjects, objects that appear or disappear between frames, and object distortions, as demonstrated on both Wan2.1-1.3B and CogVideoX-5B models.",
    "FlowMo addresses fundamental limitations in text-to-video diffusion models' ability to model temporal aspects such as motion, physics, and dynamic interactions through a novel variance-based approach that guides the generation process.",
    "The technique can be applied as a plug-and-play solution to existing text-to-video models during inference, requiring no model retraining or architectural modifications, making it highly practical for immediate deployment.",
    "The research demonstrates that meaningful temporal coherence improvements can be achieved through inference-time guidance methods, opening new directions for enhancing video generation quality without computational overhead of retraining large models."
