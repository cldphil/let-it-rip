    "The paper evaluates the hierarchical visual understanding capabilities of vision large language models (VLLMs) and finds that they struggle to follow the taxonomic hierarchy when identifying objects in images.",
    "Experiments show that VLLMs often fail to recognize the correct path from higher-level categories (e.g. Animal, Vertebrate) to more specific subcategories (e.g. Fish, Spiny-finned Fish, Anemone Fish).",
    "This limitation of VLLMs in hierarchical reasoning is surprising given their potential to unify various vision tasks and interact with humans through multimodal prompts.",
    "The paper highlights the need for comprehensive benchmarking of VLLMs to realize their full potential and identify areas for improvement.",
    "Existing benchmarks like MMBench, MME, and MMMU are mentioned as resources for evaluating multimodal models, but the focus here is specifically on hierarchical visual understanding."
