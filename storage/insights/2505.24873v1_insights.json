    "Furthermore, existing methods often rely on computationally\nexpensive sampling procedures and classifier-free guidance (CFG), resulting in\nslow inference.",
    "Motivated by the observation\nthat text condition is not best suited for this task, we simplify the\npretrained video generation model by removing textual input and cross-attention\nlayers, resulting in a more lightweight and efficient model architecture in the\nfirst stage.",
    "In the second stage, we distilled our remover on successful videos\nproduced by the stage-1 model and curated by human annotators, using a minimax\noptimization strategy to further improve editing quality and inference speed.\nSpecifically, the inner maximization identifies adversarial input noise (\"bad\nnoise\") that makes failure removals, while the outer minimization step trains\nthe model to generate high-quality removal results even under such challenging\nconditions.",
    "As a result, our method achieves a state-of-the-art video object\nremoval results with as few as 6 sampling steps and doesn't rely on CFG,\nsignificantly improving inference efficiency.",
    "Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe effectiveness and superiority of MiniMax-Remover compared to existing\nmethods."
