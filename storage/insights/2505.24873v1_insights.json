    "The proposed MiniMax-Remover is a two-stage video object removal approach that aims to improve editing quality and inference speed compared to existing methods.",
    "In the first stage, a pretrained video generation model is simplified by removing textual input and cross-attention layers, resulting in a more lightweight and efficient architecture.",
    "In the second stage, the remover is distilled on successful videos from the first stage using a minimax optimization strategy, where the inner maximization identifies adversarial input noise ('bad noise') that causes failure removals, and the outer minimization trains the model to generate high-quality removal results even under such challenging conditions.",
    "MiniMax-Remover achieves state-of-the-art video object removal results with as few as 6 sampling steps and without relying on classifier-free guidance (CFG), significantly improving inference efficiency.",
    "The results demonstrate high-quality removal of various target objects, such as a girl, chameleon, bird, lane line, and red wine glass, from videos."
