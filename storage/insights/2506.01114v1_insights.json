    "Most LLM uncertainty estimation methods are highly sensitive to decision threshold selection when there is distribution shift in calibration datasets, making real-world deployment challenging as thresholds calibrated on one dataset may not perform well on different data distributions.",
    "UE methods show significant vulnerability to adversarial prompts while maintaining robustness against previous chat history and typos, indicating that input transformation robustness varies greatly depending on the type of transformation applied.",
    "Existing UE methods face substantial challenges when applied to long-form text generation compared to their typical evaluation in short-form QA settings, suggesting current methods may not scale effectively to complex generation tasks.",
    "The study systematically evaluates 19 different UE methods across four critical deployment aspects: threshold sensitivity, input transformation robustness, long-form applicability, and multi-score aggregation strategies for practical implementation.",
    "Current evaluation practices using threshold-independent metrics like AUROC and PRR in isolated settings do not adequately reflect real-world deployment challenges, highlighting the need for more comprehensive evaluation frameworks that consider practical constraints."
