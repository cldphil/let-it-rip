    "The paper proposes a Multi-Domain Data Mixture (MoDoMoDo) framework that combines multiple datasets from diverse multimodal task domains during post-training of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) using reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR).",
    "By incorporating a mixture of datasets spanning different multimodal capabilities like vision, audio, and spatial reasoning, the approach aims to enable broad coverage and generalization across a wide range of multimodal tasks for MLLMs.",
    "Experiments show that multi-domain RLVR training with mixture prediction strategies improves the post-trained MLLM's accuracy on out-of-distribution benchmarks by an average of 5.24% compared to uniform data mixture, and 20.74% compared to the pre-finetuning baseline.",
    "The MoDoMoDo framework combines multiple reward models corresponding to each dataset during RLVR, allowing the MLLM to learn diverse multimodal capabilities simultaneously.",
    "The mixture sampling strategy used to combine datasets during training is a key factor influencing the performance gains achieved by the multi-domain approach."
