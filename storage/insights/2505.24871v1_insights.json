    "The paper proposes MoDoMoDo, a framework that combines multi-domain data mixtures with multimodal large language model (MLLM) reinforcement learning using verifiable rewards (RLVR) to boost the general reasoning capabilities of MLLMs across diverse multimodal tasks.",
    "By incorporating multiple datasets from diverse multimodal task domains during post-training instead of relying on a single dataset, MoDoMoDo aims to ensure broad coverage and generalization across a wide range of capabilities required by MLLMs.",
    "The experiments showcase that multi-domain RLVR training, when combined with mixture prediction strategies, can significantly improve the post-trained model's accuracy on out-of-distribution benchmarks by an average of 5.24% compared to uniform data mixture, and by a total of 20.74% compared to the pre-finetuning baseline.",
    "The approach addresses the challenge of effective post-training of MLLMs, which must integrate diverse data modalities with fundamentally different problem features and translate into a broad spectrum of distinct capabilities.",
    "The paper highlights the importance of incorporating diverse multimodal data during post-training to achieve the wide range of capabilities required by MLLMs, given the vast number of distinct tasks arising from multimodal compositions."
