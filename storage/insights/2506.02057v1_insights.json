    "Novel approach leverages speech prosody (tone, rhythm, stress patterns) directly to disambiguate robot instruction intent, achieving 95.79% accuracy in detecting referent intents within utterances compared to traditional text-only methods that discard these crucial cues.",
    "Integration of prosodic features with large language models via in-context learning enables robots to select appropriate task plans from ambiguous instructions with 71.96% accuracy, significantly improving human-robot communication effectiveness.",
    "First ambiguous speech dataset for robotics created to advance research in speech disambiguation, providing a standardized benchmark for evaluating prosody-based instruction understanding systems.",
    "Method bypasses traditional speech-to-text transcription bottlenecks by processing audio features directly, reducing information loss and enabling real-time intent inference for robotic systems.",
    "Demonstrates potential for widespread application in human-robot collaboration scenarios where verbal instruction clarity is critical, opening new research directions in computational paralinguistics for robotics."
