    "Current AIGC detectors achieve near-perfect accuracy on images from generators used in training but fail to generalize to unseen generators due to latent prior bias - detectors learn shortcuts from initial noise patterns rather than robust generative artifacts.",
    "On-Manifold Adversarial Training (OMAT) generates adversarial examples by optimizing initial latent noise of diffusion models under fixed conditioning, keeping perturbations on the generator's output manifold unlike pixel-space attacks that create off-manifold perturbations.",
    "GenImage++ benchmark introduced for testing against state-of-the-art generators including Flux.1 and SD3 with extended prompts and diverse styles, providing comprehensive evaluation framework for generalization capabilities.",
    "OMAT applied to ResNet50 and CLIP baselines demonstrates improved cross-generator generalization by forcing detectors to learn more robust discriminative features rather than generator-specific shortcuts.",
    "The approach addresses fundamental limitation in AI-generated content detection where models overfit to specific generator characteristics, providing pathway for more reliable detection systems across diverse generative models."
