    "LoRA-BAM introduces a lightweight out-of-distribution (OoD) detection method that monitors LoRA layers using boxed abstraction to identify queries beyond a fine-tuned model's competence, preventing unreliable responses on unfamiliar inputs.",
    "The method extracts feature vectors from fine-tuning data via the LLM, clusters them, and encloses clusters in geometric boxes - flagging questions as OoD if their feature vectors fall outside all established boxes, providing interpretable decision boundaries.",
    "A novel regularization loss is introduced during fine-tuning that encourages paraphrased questions to remain close in feature space, improving model robustness and ensuring semantically similar queries are handled consistently.",
    "The approach enlarges decision boundaries based on feature variance within clusters, making the detection more robust to natural variations in input phrasing while maintaining precision in identifying truly out-of-scope queries.",
    "LoRA-BAM complements existing defense mechanisms by providing a computationally efficient and interpretable solution to the overfitting problem in domain-specific LLM fine-tuning, with potential applications across specialized AI systems."
