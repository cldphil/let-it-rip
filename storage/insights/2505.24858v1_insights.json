    "A critical component in the trustworthiness of LLMs is reliable uncertainty\ncommunication, yet LLMs often use assertive language when conveying false\nclaims, leading to over-reliance and eroded trust.",
    "We present the first\nsystematic study of $\\textit{faithful confidence calibration}$ of LLMs,\nbenchmarking models' ability to use linguistic expressions of uncertainty that\n$\\textit{faithfully reflect}$ their intrinsic uncertainty, across a\ncomprehensive array of models, datasets, and prompting strategies.",
    "Our results\ndemonstrate that LLMs largely fail at this task, and that existing\ninterventions are insufficient: standard prompt approaches provide only\nmarginal gains, and existing, factuality-based calibration techniques can even\nharm faithful calibration. To address this critical gap, we introduce\nMetaFaith, a novel prompt-based calibration approach inspired by human\nmetacognition.",
    "We show that MetaFaith robustly improves faithful calibration\nacross diverse models and task domains, enabling up to 61% improvement in\nfaithfulness and achieving an 83% win rate over original generations as judged\nby humans."
