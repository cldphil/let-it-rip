    "LEMONADE dataset provides 39,786 multilingual conflict events across 20 languages and 171 countries, enabling global event analysis with region-specific entity coverage that addresses the challenge of aggregating diverse multilingual sources for comprehensive conflict monitoring.",
    "Abstractive Event Extraction (AEE) and Abstractive Entity Linking (AEL) represent a paradigm shift from conventional span-based extraction, using holistic document understanding to detect event arguments and normalize entities across multilingual datasets for improved cross-linguistic consistency.",
    "ZEST zero-shot retrieval-based system for abstractive entity linking demonstrates practical implementation of retrieval-augmented approaches for multilingual entity normalization without requiring extensive training data or language-specific models.",
    "The research evaluates multiple large language models on multilingual event extraction tasks and adapts existing zero-shot systems, providing benchmarks for supervised models and establishing performance baselines for real-world multilingual event processing applications.",
    "The work addresses critical infrastructure needs for global conflict monitoring and analysis by providing standardized approaches to process multilingual news sources and normalize entity references across different languages and regional contexts."
