    "N\u00b2 package provides a unified Python framework for nearest neighbor-based matrix completion methods, consolidating multiple NN approaches through a modular, extensible interface that enables rapid experimentation and benchmarking across diverse applications.",
    "Nearest neighbor methods have re-emerged as competitive alternatives to traditional matrix completion approaches, offering strong empirical performance with theoretical guarantees including entry-wise error bounds, confidence intervals, and minimax optimality properties.",
    "The framework introduces a new NN variant that achieves state-of-the-art results in several experimental settings, demonstrating the practical value of the unified approach for method development and comparison.",
    "N\u00b2 supports both researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive benchmark suite including real-world datasets from healthcare (HeartSteps V1), recommender systems (MovieLens), causal inference (Proposition 99), and LLM evaluation (PromptEval), moving beyond synthetic scenarios.",
    "The modular design enables easy integration of new NN-based methods and supports cross-validation functionality, making it suitable for production deployment and academic research with robust evaluation capabilities."
