    "The paper proposes treating internal reasoning and external actions as equivalent epistemic tools, enabling systematic coordination between introspection and interaction for more efficient agent decision-making.",
    "Aligning an agent's tool-use decision-making boundary with its knowledge boundary can minimize unnecessary tool use and maximize epistemic efficiency, shifting focus from action execution to knowledge-driven intelligence systems.",
    "A cyclical training paradigm of RL\u2192SFT\u2192RL\u2192SFT is proposed where reinforcement learning discovers high-quality trajectories aligned with knowledge boundaries, and supervised fine-tuning consolidates these behaviors for improved stability and generalization.",
    "The framework advocates for optimizing both outcomes and processes in RL training to produce agents that are accurate, efficient, interpretable, and better aligned with real-world deployment constraints through restraint and self-awareness.",
    "Prompt engineering can be used to develop task-specific agentic workflows across various domains achieving adaptation without additional fine-tuning, demonstrating practical implementation paths for the theoretical framework."
