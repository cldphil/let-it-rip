    "AD-SVFD introduces a novel deep learning approach combining auto-decoders with Neural ODEs for deformable registration of vascular anatomies, representing geometries as weighted point clouds and modeling deformations as ODE solutions with neural network-defined right-hand sides.",
    "The method enables both registration of existing vascular shapes to predefined references and generation of synthetic anatomies through its auto-decoder structure, providing dual functionality for medical imaging applications.",
    "Deformations are modeled as solutions at unit time of ODEs with time-independent right-hand sides expressed through artificial neural networks, with backward integration defining inverse transformations for bidirectional shape manipulation.",
    "Model optimization uses Chamfer Distance minimization between deformed and reference point clouds, providing a geometrically meaningful loss function for vascular shape alignment and registration tasks.",
    "The auto-decoder architecture enables generalization across different vascular shapes without requiring separate training for each anatomy type, making it scalable for diverse cardiovascular applications and synthetic data generation."
