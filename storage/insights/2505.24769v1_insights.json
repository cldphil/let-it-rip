    "When $N$ is\nsmaller than the dimension of the inputs $d$, so that only a fraction of\nrelevant directions of variation are present in the training data, we\ndemonstrate how both regularization and early stopping help to prevent\noverfitting.",
    "For $N > d$, we find that the sampling distributions of linear\ndiffusion models approach their optimum (measured by the Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence) linearly with $d/N$, independent of the specifics of the data\ndistribution."
