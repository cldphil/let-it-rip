    "GPT-4o and o1-mini achieved the best performance for extracting diary writing purposes from historical texts, significantly outperforming template-based baseline methods in identifying intentions like documenting life events, self-reflection, and language practice.",
    "LLMs can effectively analyze large corpora of personal narratives to extract meaningful patterns in writing purposes, demonstrating practical applications for digital humanities research and historical text analysis at scale.",
    "The method successfully identified and clustered various purposes of diary writing across different demographic variables (gender, age, year), providing a systematic approach for understanding motivations behind personal writing across historical periods.",
    "Template-based approaches proved significantly less effective than LLM-based methods for purpose extraction, indicating that modern language models provide substantial advantages for analyzing subjective content and implicit intentions in text.",
    "The research demonstrates that LLMs can be applied to historical document analysis (Soviet-era diaries from 1922-1929), opening possibilities for automated analysis of archival materials and personal narratives in digital humanities projects."
