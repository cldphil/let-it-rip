    "The paper introduces a new benchmark called LongBench-T2I to evaluate text-to-image models on their ability to follow complex instructions involving multiple objects, attributes, and spatial relationships.",
    "It proposes an agent-based framework to guide the image generation process through iterative reasoning and validation steps, aiming to improve controllability and handle long-form compositionality.",
    "Existing benchmarks like DrawBench, DAA-200, and T2I-CompBench are limited in scope, focusing on either short prompts, simple scenes, or isolated compositionality aspects.",
    "The LongBench-T2I benchmark systematically assesses generated images based on nine key elements extracted from the instructions, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of complex prompt handling.",
    "The agent-based framework incorporates techniques like self-correction, chain-of-thought prompting, and structured generation to improve the generation process for complex prompts."
