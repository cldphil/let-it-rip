    "Previous reviews have predominantly adopted model-oriented perspectives, neglecting fundamental preprocessing steps like modality derivation and data augmentation, which are critical components beyond model design in skeleton-based action recognition systems.",
    "Human-perception-based coordinate system transformations can improve robustness to scaling, rotation, and translation of skeletal data by converting original skeletal sequences to mitigate confusion from inconsistent orientations.",
    "Task-oriented framework decomposition reveals that skeleton-based action recognition involves multiple sub-tasks that require comprehensive understanding beyond just model architecture selection.",
    "Current preprocessing approaches rely on human-defined heuristics rather than optimized methods, using body joints like hip, shoulder, or neck to define body planes for alignment purposes.",
    "The field lacks comprehensive understanding of the complete pipeline from data preprocessing to model deployment, indicating need for more holistic approaches to skeleton-based action recognition implementation."
  ],
  "limitations": [
    "Coordinate transformations can result in loss of critical motion information such as trajectory, speed of body center, and dynamic changes in body orientation, potentially reducing walking to walking-in-place or removing rotation from dance movements",
    "Body plane definition using joints like hip, shoulder, or neck may not always suit alignment purposes due to the non-rigid nature of the human body structure"
