    "FlexSelect achieves up to 9x speed-up on LLaVA-Video-7B model while maintaining performance by using a two-component approach: training-free token ranking pipeline that leverages cross-modal attention weights to estimate video token importance, and a rank-supervised lightweight selector trained to replicate rankings and filter redundant tokens.",
    "The method works as a plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated into various VideoLLM architectures including LLaVA-Video, InternVL, and Qwen-VL without requiring architectural changes, making it broadly applicable across different video understanding systems.",
    "FlexSelect delivers strong performance gains across multiple long-video benchmarks including VideoMME, MLVU, LongVB, and LVBench, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world video understanding tasks while significantly reducing computational and memory demands.",
    "The approach uses cross-modal attention patterns from a reference transformer layer to identify semantically relevant content, providing a principled way to determine which video tokens are most important for understanding without manual feature engineering.",
    "By extending temporal context length for VideoLLMs while reducing computational overhead, FlexSelect addresses the fundamental scalability challenge in long-form video understanding, enabling practical deployment of video AI systems for extended content analysis."
