    "The Medical World Model (MeWM) introduces the first world model in medicine that visually predicts future disease states based on clinical decisions, combining vision-language models as policy generators with tumor generative models as dynamics simulators for treatment planning.",
    "The system comprises two key components: policy models that generate clinical treatment action plans, and dynamics models that simulate tumor progression or regression under specific treatment conditions, enabling predictive medical decision-making.",
    "An inverse dynamics model applies survival analysis to simulated post-treatment tumors, enabling quantitative evaluation of treatment efficacy. This approach allows clinicians to assess potential treatment outcomes before implementation, potentially improving patient care through data-driven decision support.",
    "The implementation leverages recent advances in large generative models, specifically adapting vision-language architectures for medical applications. The system requires integration of clinical imaging data with treatment protocols, demanding substantial computational resources for real-time tumor simulation. The approach necessitates training on large medical datasets with longitudinal patient data to achieve reliable predictive accuracy for clinical deployment.",
    "This work establishes a foundation for AI-assisted clinical decision-making in oncology, potentially transforming treatment planning workflows by providing visual predictions of disease progression under different therapeutic interventions."
