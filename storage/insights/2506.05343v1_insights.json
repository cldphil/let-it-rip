    "ContentV achieves state-of-the-art video generation performance (85.14 on VBench) with only 8B parameters, demonstrating that efficient architectures can compete with larger models while requiring significantly less computational resources.",
    "The model was successfully trained in just 4 weeks using 256\u00d764 GB NPUs, proving that high-quality video generation models can be developed with limited compute budgets through strategic architectural and training optimizations.",
    "Three key innovations enable efficiency: (1) minimalist architecture maximizing reuse of pre-trained image generation models, (2) systematic multi-stage training with flow matching, and (3) cost-effective reinforcement learning with human feedback without additional human annotations.",
    "The model generates diverse, high-quality videos across multiple resolutions and durations from text prompts, making it practical for real-world content creation applications where flexibility in output format is crucial.",
    "All code and models are made publicly available at https://contentv.github.io, enabling practitioners to implement and build upon these efficient training techniques for their own video generation projects."
