    "Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS) achieves 8x KV cache compression with only 1,000 training steps while maintaining better accuracy than training-free sparse attention methods, making it highly practical for deployment.",
    "Inference-time hyper-scaling through KV cache compression enables generating more tokens within the same compute budget, addressing the bottleneck where generation cost is limited by cache size rather than token count.",
    "DMS delays token eviction instead of prematurely discarding cached tokens, implicitly merging representations to preserve critical information during compression.",
    "The method demonstrates significant performance improvements on Qwen-R1 32B: 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 points on GPQA, and 9.6 points on other benchmarks for comparable inference runtime and memory load.",
    "The approach enables practical inference-time scaling by trading KV cache efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy through longer sequence generation within fixed compute budgets."
