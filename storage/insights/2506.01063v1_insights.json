    "CDMizer framework combines LLMs and RAG with template-driven approach to transform unstructured financial derivative contracts into structured Common Domain Model (CDM) format, ensuring syntactic correctness and schema adherence through controlled generation process.",
    "Depth-based retrieval and hierarchical generation methodology preserves contextual relationships while enabling incremental extraction and validation of contract information, addressing key limitations of direct generation methods in financial document processing.",
    "Template-driven approach guarantees improved scalability and modular processing compared to traditional direct generation methods, specifically designed for Over-the-Counter (OTC) financial derivative contract transformation with predefined schema alignment.",
    "Framework includes LLM-powered evaluation system to assess completeness and accuracy of structured representations, providing automated validation capabilities for contract encoding quality assurance in financial applications.",
    "Research establishes foundation for AI-driven document understanding in financial services with potential extensions to ISDA Master Agreement processing, smart contract conversion, and automated legal document validation across complex financial contexts."
