    "Although existing unified models deliver strong performance on\nvision-language understanding and text-to-image generation, their models are\nlimited in exploring image perception and manipulation tasks, which are\nurgently desired by users for wide applications. Recently, OpenAI released\ntheir powerful GPT-4o-Image model for comprehensive image perception and\nmanipulation, achieving expressive capability and attracting community\ninterests. By observing the performance of GPT-4o-Image in our carefully\nconstructed experiments, we infer that GPT-4o-Image leverages features\nextracted by semantic encoders instead of VAE, while VAEs are considered\nessential components in many image manipulation models.",
    "Motivated by such\ninspiring observations, we present a unified generative framework named\nUniWorld based on semantic features provided by powerful visual-language models\nand contrastive semantic encoders.",
    "As a result, we build a strong unified model\nusing only 1% amount of BAGEL's data, which consistently outperforms BAGEL on\nimage editing benchmarks. UniWorld also maintains competitive image\nunderstanding and generation capabilities, achieving strong performance across\nmultiple image perception tasks. We fully open-source our models, including\nmodel weights, training and evaluation scripts, and datasets."
