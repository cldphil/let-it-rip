    "MINT-CoT introduces Mathematical INterleaved Tokens that adaptively integrate visual tokens into textual reasoning steps via an Interleave Token mechanism, enabling dynamic selection of visual regions of any shapes within mathematical figures rather than being limited to coarse-grained box-shaped regions.",
    "The approach constructs a specialized MINT-CoT dataset containing 54K mathematical problems where each reasoning step is aligned with visual regions at the token level, accompanied by a rigorous data generation pipeline for creating high-quality multimodal mathematical reasoning data.",
    "MINT-CoT implements a three-stage training strategy that progressively builds the model's capability to interleave visual and textual reasoning, addressing the limitation of existing vision encoders' poor perception of mathematical content.",
    "The method eliminates dependence on external capabilities for visual modification by integrating visual processing directly into the chain-of-thought reasoning process, making it more self-contained and efficient for mathematical problem-solving.",
    "MINT-CoT represents a significant advancement in multimodal mathematical reasoning by bridging the gap between textual Chain-of-Thought reasoning and visual understanding, with potential applications in educational technology, automated tutoring systems, and mathematical problem-solving assistants."
