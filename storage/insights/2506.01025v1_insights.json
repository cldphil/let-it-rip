    "The Anatomically Coherent Modality Translation (ACMT) network uses hierarchical feature disentanglement with shallow-layer features for texture consistency and deep-layer features for boundary preservation, addressing critical alignment issues in MR-US registration for prostate cancer diagnosis.",
    "Introduction of an intermediate pseudo modality approach where both MR and US images are translated toward a common intermediate domain, rather than converting one modality directly to another, effectively reducing modality-specific discrepancies.",
    "The method leverages diffusion models for modality translation, demonstrating superior performance in preserving crucial anatomical boundaries while mitigating texture and appearance differences between MR and ultrasound imaging modalities.",
    "The hierarchical feature design allows for targeted processing of different image characteristics - using shallow layers for surface-level texture matching and deep layers for structural boundary preservation, providing more anatomically coherent translations.",
    "The approach addresses fundamental bottlenecks in traditional translation methods for downstream registration tasks, with potential applications extending beyond prostate imaging to other multimodal medical image registration scenarios."
