    "Character-level log parsing using binary-coded decimal recognition achieves comparable accuracy to LLM-based parsers while requiring significantly fewer computational resources, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.",
    "Novel neural architecture aggregates character embeddings to estimate sequences of binary-coded decimals, enabling highly granular log template extraction that captures fine-grained details missed by existing parsers.",
    "The proposed approach outperforms semantic parsers in efficiency while maintaining high accuracy on both revised Loghub-2k benchmark and manually annotated industrial datasets, demonstrating practical viability.",
    "Low-resource requirements make the parser deployable in production environments where computational efficiency is critical, addressing the scalability challenges of processing large-scale system logs.",
    "Character-level processing enables better handling of variable components and static templates in log messages, improving downstream tasks like anomaly detection, security enhancement, and audit trail analysis."
