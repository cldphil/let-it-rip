    "Establishes theoretical connection between generative diffusion models and continuous-state associative memory models through Morse-Smale dynamical systems framework, providing unified mathematical foundation for understanding both paradigms.",
    "Demonstrates that diffusion models can be viewed as white-noise perturbed versions of gradient-based associative memory systems, enabling transfer of stability analysis techniques from dynamical systems theory to generative modeling.",
    "Proves that structural stability properties of Morse-Smale flows imply stability for diffusion models at vanishing noise levels, providing theoretical guarantees for model robustness in low-noise regimes.",
    "Characterizes generic transition from generation to memory retrieval as noise levels diminish, showing that diffusion models naturally interpolate between generative and associative memory behaviors based on noise parameter.",
    "Identifies that stability holds at all but isolated points in learning landscapes for both associative memory and diffusion models, with small sets of generic bifurcations characterizing qualitative transitions between stable regimes."
