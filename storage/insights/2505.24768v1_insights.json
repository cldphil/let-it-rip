    "The paper investigates the impact of dataset diversity on the performance of language models during supervised fine-tuning (SFT).",
    "Six distinct diversity-control strategies spanning macro-, meso-, and microscopic levels were applied to both instructions and responses to construct fixed-size datasets from a corpus of 117,000 open-source SFT samples.",
    "Results showed that while macroscopic and mesoscopic strategies led to higher performance with increasing diversity, the microscopic strategy in responses exhibited a stronger correlation between model performance and the degree of diversity, as well as superior performance with maximum diversity across all strategies.",
    "The microscopic strategy involved decomposing instructions into atomic components and increasing diversity by covering more instruction unit tags.",
    "The findings offer actionable insights for constructing high-performance SFT datasets by controlling diversity at different levels."
