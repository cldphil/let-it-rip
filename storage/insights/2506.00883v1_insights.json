  "key_findings": [
    "MLLM benchmarks contain significant redundancy - using only 50 strategically selected questions through an interview approach can achieve 0.65-0.84 rank similarity to full benchmark evaluation, dramatically reducing computational costs while maintaining evaluation accuracy.",
    "The interview-based evaluation method uses an adaptive questioning strategy where an MLLM interviewer selects questions based on previous responses, creating a dynamic assessment process that focuses on effective instances rather than exhaustive testing.",
    "The approach demonstrates consistent performance across multiple benchmark datasets including A-Bench, Q-Bench, MMT-Bench, and SEED-Bench, with interview methods significantly outperforming random question selection (0.81-0.84 vs 0.61-0.77 similarity scores).",
    "Implementation involves a judging module that uses LLM-based verification to handle answer randomness and calculate performance metrics including correct rates at different difficulty levels and information distribution analysis, making it deployable with existing MLLM infrastructure.",
    "The method was validated across 19 different MLLMs using both API calls and local deployments, suggesting broad applicability for reducing benchmark evaluation costs in production environments while maintaining reliable performance assessment."
  ],
  "limitations": [
    "The approach still requires an initial MLLM to act as the interviewer, which may introduce bias based on the interviewer model's capabilities and question selection strategy",
    "Limited information provided about the specific criteria for question selection and the potential impact of interviewer model choice on evaluation reliability"
