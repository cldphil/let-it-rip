    "We propose CURE, a novel reinforcement learning framework with a dedicated\nreward design that co-evolves coding and unit test generation capabilities\nbased on their interaction outcomes, without any ground-truth code as\nsupervision. This approach enables flexible and scalable training and allows\nthe unit tester to learn directly from the coder's mistakes.",
    "Our derived\nReasonFlux-Coder-7B and 14B models improve code generation accuracy by 5.3% and\nBest-of-N accuracy by 9.0% after optimization on Qwen2.5-Instruct models,\noutperforming similarly sized Qwen-Coder, DeepSeek-Coder, and Seed-Coder.",
    "They\nnaturally extend to downstream tasks such as test-time scaling and agentic\ncoding-achieving a 8.1% improvement over the base model. For the long-CoT\nmodel, our ReasonFlux-Coder-4B consistently outperforms Qwen3-4B while\nachieving 64.8% inference efficiency in unit test generation.",
    "Notably, we also\nfind that our model can serve as an effective reward model for reinforcement\nlearning on base models. Project: https://github.com/Gen-Verse/CURE."
