    "Chain-of-Translation (CoTR) prompting technique enables effective emotion recognition for low-resource languages by translating Marathi sentences to English and applying emotion labeling in a single prompt, demonstrating a practical approach for overcoming language barriers in NLP tasks.",
    "GPT-4 outperformed Llama3-405B in generating high-quality synthetic annotations for emotion recognition training data, providing guidance for practitioners on selecting appropriate LLMs for data annotation tasks in resource-constrained scenarios.",
    "The research created L3Cube-MahaEmotions dataset with 11 fine-grained emotion labels, using synthetic annotations for training data while maintaining manually labeled validation and test sets as gold-standard benchmarks. This hybrid approach balances scalability with quality assurance for emotion recognition model development.",
    "BERT-based models trained on synthetic labels failed to surpass GPT-4 performance, revealing important limitations in knowledge transfer from LLM-generated annotations to smaller fine-tuned models. This finding suggests that practitioners should carefully evaluate whether synthetic data generation or direct LLM inference better serves their specific use cases, considering factors like computational resources, latency requirements, and accuracy needs.",
    "The study highlights the critical importance of high-quality human-labeled data for emotion recognition tasks, suggesting that while synthetic annotation can scale dataset creation, manual validation remains essential for reliable benchmarking and model evaluation."
