    "The proposed SUMO (Subspace-Aware Moment-Orthogonalization) optimizer employs exact singular value decomposition (SVD) for moment orthogonalization within a dynamically adapted low-dimensional subspace, enabling norm-inducing steepest descent optimization steps aligned with the spectral characteristics of the loss landscape.",
    "SUMO theoretically establishes an upper bound on the approximation errors associated with commonly used methods like Newton-Schulz orthogonalization approximation, proving their dependence on the condition numbers of moments encountered during LLM training.",
    "Empirical evaluations confirm that SUMO accelerates convergence, enhances stability, improves performance, and reduces memory requirements by up to 20% compared to state-of-the-art methods.",
    "The paper demonstrates that low-rank optimization not only reduces memory usage but also converges toward increasingly compact subspaces during LLM training.",
    "SUMO explicitly aligns optimization steps with the spectral characteristics of the loss landscape, effectively mitigating approximation errors associated with commonly used methods."
