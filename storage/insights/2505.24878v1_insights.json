    "The paper introduces Open CaptchaWorld, a comprehensive web-based platform for testing and benchmarking multimodal language models on solving various types of CAPTCHA challenges.",
    "The authors evaluate state-of-the-art multimodal LLM agents like GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini on 20 types of modern CAPTCHA puzzles using a unified Browser Use agent setup.",
    "The results show a significant performance gap between humans (93.3% success rate) and the best performing agent, Browser-Use Openai-o3 (40% success rate), highlighting the limitations of current multimodal agents on CAPTCHA solving tasks.",
    "The paper conducts a fine-grained case study to analyze the success and failure patterns of different models across different CAPTCHA types and reasoning demands.",
    "The Open CaptchaWorld benchmark serves as a vital diagnostic tool for identifying the weaknesses of multimodal reasoning systems and guiding the development of more robust agents capable of solving real-world CAPTCHA challenges."
