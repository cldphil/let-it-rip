    "The paper proposes GenSpace, a new benchmark and evaluation pipeline to assess the spatial awareness of current image generation models in both text-to-image generation and instruction-based image editing tasks.",
    "The spatial awareness capabilities are categorized into three levels of increasing difficulty: spatial pose (understanding 3D position and orientation), spatial relation (reasoning about object positioning and viewpoints), and spatial measurement (interpreting quantitative spatial details).",
    "The evaluation pipeline uses multiple visual foundation models to reconstruct 3D scene geometry, providing a more accurate and human-aligned metric of spatial faithfulness.",
    "The results show that while AI models can create visually appealing images and follow general instructions, they struggle with specific 3D details like object placement, relationships, and measurements.",
    "Three core limitations in the spatial perception of current state-of-the-art image generation models are identified: object perspective understanding, egocentric-allocentric transformation, and metric measurement adherence."

  "main_contribution": "The paper's primary contribution is the development of GenSpace, a novel benchmark and evaluation pipeline that comprehensively assesses the spatial awareness of current image generation models. It introduces a specialized evaluation metric that reconstructs 3D scene geometry using multiple visual foundation models, providing a more accurate and human-aligned measure of spatial faithfulness.",
  "limitations": [
    "The paper does not provide specific quantitative results or performance metrics.",
    "The implementation details and resource requirements for the proposed approach are not discussed."
