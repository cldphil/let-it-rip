    "The paper proposes GenSpace, a new benchmark and evaluation pipeline to assess the spatial awareness capabilities of current image generation models in both text-to-image generation and instruction-based image editing tasks.",
    "The spatial awareness capabilities are categorized into three levels of increasing difficulty: spatial pose (understanding 3D position and orientation), spatial relation (reasoning about relative positioning of objects), and spatial measurement (interpreting quantitative spatial details).",
    "The evaluation results using GPT-4o show that while AI models can create visually appealing images and follow general instructions, they struggle with specific 3D details like object placement, relationships, and measurements.",
    "Three core limitations in the spatial perception of current state-of-the-art image generation models are identified: 1) Object Perspective Understanding, 2) Egocentric-Allocentric Transformation, and 3) Metric Measurement Adherence.",
    "The paper proposes a specialized evaluation pipeline and metric that reconstructs 3D scene geometry using multiple visual foundation models to provide a more accurate and human-aligned metric of spatial faithfulness."
