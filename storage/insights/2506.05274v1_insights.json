    "Introduced TF-CoVR, the first large-scale benchmark for temporally fine-grained Composed Video Retrieval with 180K triplets from gymnastics and diving domains, addressing the gap in existing benchmarks that focus only on appearance shifts or coarse event changes.",
    "Developed a novel benchmark construction approach where each query-modification pair is associated with multiple valid target videos (3.9 on average) rather than single targets, better reflecting real-world scenarios like sports highlight generation.",
    "Proposed TF-CoVR-Base, a two-stage training framework that first pre-trains a video encoder on fine-grained action classification to obtain temporally discriminative embeddings, then aligns composed queries with target videos for improved temporal understanding.",
    "Utilized LLM prompting to generate modification text based on label differences between clips from different videos, creating more realistic and diverse query-target relationships compared to previous single-video approaches.",
    "Focused on sports domains (gymnastics and diving) which contain subtle, fast-paced temporal differences that are challenging for existing video retrieval systems, providing a more rigorous evaluation framework for temporal video understanding."

  "limitations": [
    "Limited to specific sports domains (gymnastics and diving) which may not generalize to other video types or temporal patterns",
