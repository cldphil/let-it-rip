    "The Agent-X benchmark evaluates deep multimodal reasoning capabilities of AI agents in vision-centric tasks, where queries avoid explicit tool references or instructions to encourage independent reasoning and action.",
    "The evaluation framework assesses the correctness and logical coherence of each reasoning step, as well as the effectiveness of tool usage throughout the task.",
    "Even state-of-the-art models like GPT, Gemini, and Qwen families struggle to solve multi-step vision tasks in Agent-X, achieving less than 50% full-chain success.",
    "The results highlight key bottlenecks in current large multimodal models' reasoning and tool-use capabilities, identifying future research directions in vision-centric agentic reasoning models.",
    "The Agent-X benchmark aims to distinguish genuine reasoning from inconsistencies and confabulations in reasoning chains, as illustrated by an example in Figure 1."
