    "MokA achieves significant performance improvements over standard LoRA across multiple multimodal scenarios, with SEED-Bench scores improving from 73.41 to 75.71 (3.1% improvement) by separating unimodal and cross-modal adaptation components.",
    "Current efficient fine-tuning methods for multimodal large language models are suboptimal because they directly borrow techniques from text-only LLMs without considering multimodal characteristics, leading to underutilization of all modalities.",
    "The proposed method decomposes multimodal adaptation into two essential components: unimodal adaptation using modality-specific parameters for information compression, and cross-modal adaptation for explicit enhancement of inter-modal interactions.",
    "Cross-attention visualization demonstrates that MokA enables text tokens to receive higher attention weights from related modalities (e.g., 'sound' token receives greater attention from audio modality), facilitating better cross-modal alignment.",
    "MokA shows consistent improvements across three representative multimodal scenarios (audio-visual-text, visual-text, and speech-text) and multiple LLM backbones, demonstrating broad applicability for multimodal AI systems."
