    "MokA achieves significant performance improvements over standard LoRA across multiple multimodal scenarios, with SEED-Bench scores improving from 73.41 to 75.71 (3.1% improvement) while maintaining efficient parameter usage through low-rank adaptation techniques.",
    "The method addresses a critical limitation in current multimodal fine-tuning approaches by separating unimodal adaptation and cross-modal adaptation, rather than directly borrowing techniques from text-only LLMs that neglect multimodal characteristics.",
    "Cross-attention visualization demonstrates that MokA enables semantically relevant text tokens to receive higher attention weights for corresponding modalities (e.g., 'sound' token gets higher attention for audio modality), improving cross-modal alignment and interaction.",
    "The approach is validated across three representative multimodal scenarios (audio-visual-text, visual-text, and speech-text) with multiple LLM backbones, showing broad applicability and consistent improvements over baseline methods including standard LoRA and Multiple LoRA variants.",
    "MokA compresses unimodal information through modality-specific parameters while explicitly enhancing cross-modal interaction, providing a systematic framework for multimodal adaptation that can be applied to various MLLM architectures and downstream tasks."
