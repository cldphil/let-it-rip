    "LLMs can generate syntactically correct smart contracts from natural language legal contracts, but show significant variance in legal compliance with larger models generally performing better at capturing legal requirements and translating them into executable code.",
    "A novel process-based evaluation framework was developed that models both legal and smart contracts as processes, enabling quantitative measurement of legal compliance through behavioral comparison rather than traditional code quality metrics.",
    "Four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1 70b) were evaluated using structured zero-shot prompting with Plan-and-Solve approach across 20 smart contracts generated from 5 legal contracts, providing comprehensive benchmarking data.",
    "The research addresses the critical gap between legal contract requirements and smart contract implementation by automating the translation process, reducing the need for dual expertise in both legal and software development domains while minimizing manual effort.",
    "The study establishes a foundation for automated legal compliance checking in smart contract development, with implications for reducing legal risks in blockchain applications and enabling broader adoption of smart contracts in regulated industries."
