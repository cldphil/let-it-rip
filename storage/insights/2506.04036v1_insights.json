    "Over 98.8% of 10,000 real-world custom GPTs are vulnerable to instruction leaking attacks through adversarial prompts, revealing a massive security gap in the OpenAI GPT ecosystem with over 3 million custom GPTs at risk since November 2023.",
    "Three-phase instruction leaking attack (ILA) methodology successfully extracts proprietary instructions from GPTs with different defense levels, threatening intellectual property of developers who invest in creating custom GPT instructions.",
    "Unwanted data access behavior by custom GPTs and integrated third-party services creates significant privacy risks for users, as GPTs can access and potentially misuse personal information without explicit consent.",
    "Functional consistency validation through mimic GPT creation demonstrates that reconstructed instructions closely resemble original ones, proving the effectiveness of instruction extraction attacks and the inadequacy of current defense mechanisms.",
    "The vast scale of the vulnerability (affecting nearly all tested GPTs) indicates systemic security flaws in the OpenAI platform's protection mechanisms, requiring immediate attention from both platform providers and custom GPT developers."
