    "LoMAP introduces a training-free method that projects guided samples onto low-rank subspaces approximated from offline datasets, preventing infeasible trajectory generation in diffusion-based planning without requiring model retraining or additional data collection.",
    "The research identifies that inaccurate guidance during sampling procedures is the primary cause of infeasible trajectory generation in diffusion models, with a mathematically derived lower bound on the guidance gap demonstrating manifold deviation issues.",
    "Selective manifold projection applied during intermediate to later stages of reverse diffusion process significantly reduces computational costs while enhancing performance, leveraging the observation that Tweedie-based denoisers exhibit biases toward high-density features making early projections less impactful.",
    "The method uses rank-r principal component analysis to approximate local manifolds of feasible trajectories and limits search to relevant clusters, enabling handling of large datasets and high-dimensional state-action spaces for long-horizon offline reinforcement learning tasks.",
    "LoMAP functions as a standalone module that can be incorporated into hierarchical diffusion planners, providing performance enhancements for safety-critical applications where trajectory feasibility is paramount, with validation on standard offline RL benchmarks."
