    "TRiMM introduces a three-module transformer architecture combining cross-modal attention for speech-gesture temporal alignment, long-context autoregressive modeling with sliding window mechanism, and large-scale gesture matching system with atomic action library for real-time 3D gesture generation in digital humans.",
    "The framework addresses critical limitations in existing LLM-driven digital human systems by enabling real-time synthesis and long-text comprehension, solving the bottleneck of processing extended speech sequences while maintaining temporal coherence between modalities.",
    "Implementation includes a lightweight pipeline developed in Unreal Engine, demonstrating practical deployment considerations for real-time applications and providing a concrete development framework for digital human interaction systems.",
    "The large-scale gesture matching system constructs an atomic action library enabling real-time retrieval, suggesting a scalable approach to gesture synthesis that can be adapted across different digital human applications and contexts.",
    "The multi-modal framework represents advancement in co-speech gesture generation by integrating transformer-based attention mechanisms with practical real-time constraints, indicating potential for broader applications in virtual assistants, gaming, and interactive media."
