  "key_findings": [
    "The system demonstrates unified multimodal perception capabilities by combining recognition, explanation, captioning, and segmentation in a single framework that can process both images and videos, showing comprehensive object understanding beyond simple classification.",
    "The approach provides contextual definitions and functionality explanations for detected objects, as demonstrated with examples like hang tags on pets and taxi vehicles, enabling more interpretable AI systems for real-world applications.",
    "The system generates detailed captions that include specific visual attributes, materials, and contextual information, such as describing an aluminum alloy ladder's cylindrical rungs and parallel side rails with slight taper toward the top.",
    "The framework supports promptable video captioning capabilities, extending beyond static image analysis to temporal understanding, which is crucial for video surveillance, content moderation, and automated video annotation applications.",
    "The multi-institutional collaboration between CUHK, HKU, PolyU, and Peking University demonstrates the scalability and academic validation of the approach, with potential for broad adoption across different research and commercial contexts."
