    "Search Arena dataset contains over 24,000 paired multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs and 12,000 human preference votes, providing the largest-scale evaluation framework for search-augmented systems across diverse intents and languages.",
    "User preferences are significantly influenced by the number of citations even when cited content does not directly support attributed claims, revealing a critical gap between perceived credibility and actual factual support that developers must address.",
    "Search augmentation dramatically improves performance on factual question-answering tasks like SimpleQA with models achieving up to 90% accuracy, but degrades performance on complex reasoning tasks like ArenaHard-v2, indicating task-specific optimization needs.",
    "Community-driven platforms are generally preferred as citation sources over static encyclopedic sources, suggesting that search-augmented systems should prioritize dynamic, community-validated content for better user acceptance.",
    "Cross-arena analysis reveals that search-augmented LLMs perform differently in general-purpose chat environments versus search-integrated settings, requiring separate evaluation frameworks and optimization strategies for different deployment contexts."

  "limitations": [
    "High computational cost of running search-augmented LLMs limits evaluation scale to 500 questions per model subset",
    "Performance degradation on complex reasoning tasks when search is enabled suggests current integration methods are not optimal for all use cases"
