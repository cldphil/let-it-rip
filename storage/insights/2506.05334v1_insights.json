    "Created Search Arena dataset with over 24,000 paired multi-turn user interactions and 12,000 human preference votes, revealing that users are influenced by citation quantity even when citations don't directly support claims, indicating a gap between perceived and actual credibility in search-augmented LLMs.",
    "Search augmentation significantly improves performance on factual question-answering tasks like SimpleQA (models saturate at around 90% accuracy), but degrades performance on complex reasoning tasks like ArenaHard-v2, suggesting search is beneficial for fact-retrieval but may interfere with reasoning capabilities.",
    "User preferences vary significantly across different source types, with community-driven platforms generally preferred over static encyclopedic sources, indicating that source diversity and community validation are important factors in search-augmented system design.",
    "Cross-arena analysis testing search-augmented LLMs in general chat environments and conventional LLMs in search-intensive tasks reveals different performance patterns across benchmarks, with Search Arena and ArenaHard-v2 providing better model separability than SimpleQA which shows performance saturation.",
    "The study demonstrates that existing evaluation datasets are limited in scale and scope, often constrained to static single-turn fact-checking, highlighting the need for more comprehensive multi-turn evaluation frameworks that capture real-world search-augmented LLM usage patterns."
