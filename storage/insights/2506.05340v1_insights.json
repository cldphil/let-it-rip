    "Grafting enables architectural exploration of diffusion transformers without costly pretraining by editing pretrained DiT-XL/2 models, allowing researchers to test new designs under small compute budgets through systematic replacement of components like attention mechanisms and MLPs.",
    "Hybrid designs created via grafting achieve significant performance improvements: replacing softmax attention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention variants, with one configuration achieving 1.43x speedup while maintaining <2% drop in GenEval score (47.78 vs 49.75).",
    "Converting model depth to width through grafting by parallelizing transformer block pairs reduces model depth by 2x (28\u219214 blocks) while achieving FID=2.77, outperforming comparable depth models and leveraging modern GPU parallel computation advantages.",
    "The grafting approach is informed by analysis of activation behavior and attention locality patterns in pretrained models, providing a systematic methodology for architectural modifications that preserves model quality while enabling structural innovations.",
    "This represents the first successful attempt to convert sequential transformer blocks into parallel structures in pretrained diffusion transformers, demonstrating that existing architectures can be fundamentally restructured without full retraining, opening new possibilities for efficient model design."
