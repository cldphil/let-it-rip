    "Grafting enables architectural exploration of diffusion transformers without costly pretraining by editing pretrained DiT-XL/2 models. This approach allows researchers to test new architectures under small compute budgets, significantly reducing the barrier to architectural investigation.",
    "Hybrid designs created through grafting achieve competitive performance: replacing softmax attention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention maintains model quality while potentially improving efficiency. The method successfully integrates different operators into existing transformer architectures.",
    "Converting model depth to width via grafting shows promising results - parallelizing transformer blocks reduces depth by 2x (28\u219214 blocks) while achieving FID=2.77, outperforming comparable depth models. This represents the first successful attempt to convert sequential transformer blocks to parallel in pretrained DiTs.",
    "Grafted models demonstrate practical speedups in real applications: achieving 1.43x speedup with less than 2% drop in GenEval score (47.78 vs. 49.75) on high-resolution text-to-image generation tasks, proving the method scales to production scenarios.",
    "The grafting approach opens new possibilities for architecture restructuring in pretrained models, enabling practitioners to adapt existing models for specific hardware constraints or performance requirements without starting training from scratch."
