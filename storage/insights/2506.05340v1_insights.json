    "Grafting enables architectural exploration of pretrained diffusion transformers with minimal compute cost, allowing researchers to test new designs without expensive full pretraining cycles by editing existing models.",
    "Hybrid designs created through grafting achieve competitive performance: replacing softmax attention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention while maintaining model quality with significant efficiency gains.",
    "Converting model depth to width via grafting shows practical GPU optimization benefits - parallelizing transformer blocks reduces depth by 2x (28\u219214 blocks) while achieving FID=2.77, outperforming comparable depth models.",
    "Real-world scalability demonstrated on high-resolution text-to-image generation with 1.43x speedup and less than 2% quality drop (GenEval score 47.78 vs 49.75), proving grafting works beyond toy examples.",
    "First successful attempt to convert sequential transformer blocks into parallel structures in pretrained diffusion transformers, enabling architectural restructuring without full retraining and opening new optimization pathways."
