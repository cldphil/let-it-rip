    "The paper proposes a new benchmark called LegalEval-Q for evaluating the quality of legal text generated by large language models (LLMs), focusing on aspects like clarity, coherence, and terminology usage.",
    "A regression model is developed to quantitatively assess the quality of legal texts based on the clarity, coherence, and terminology metrics.",
    "The analysis evaluates 49 different LLMs using the proposed evaluation framework and finds that model quality levels off at around 14 billion parameters, with only marginal improvement (2.7%) at 72 billion parameters.",
    "Engineering choices like quantization and context length have a negligible impact on model performance, with statistical significance thresholds above 0.016.",
    "Reasoning models consistently outperform base architectures in terms of legal text quality, and the Qwen3 series is identified as the optimal choice for cost-performance tradeoffs based on a Pareto analysis."
