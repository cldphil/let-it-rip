    "MMR-V benchmark introduces long-range, multi-frame reasoning requirements where models must analyze evidence frames that may be far from the question frame, addressing a critical gap in existing video understanding benchmarks that only focus on adjacent frame perception.",
    "Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate significant shortcomings in deep multimodal reasoning, often defaulting to text-dominant reasoning processes that yield incorrect answers rather than grounding analysis in video content.",
    "The benchmark reveals that effective Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning requires deep multimodal reasoning grounded in video content, while poor CoT performs only shallow video perception and relies heavily on textual analysis.",
    "Models struggle with tasks that require reasoning over hidden information beyond direct perception, indicating that current video understanding capabilities are limited to surface-level pattern matching rather than true inferential reasoning.",
    "The research establishes a new evaluation framework for video reasoning that goes beyond simple understanding tasks, requiring models to locate multi-frame evidence and conduct complex reasoning across temporal sequences."
