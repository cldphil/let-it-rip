    "Current LLM evaluations significantly underestimate model capabilities by overlooking 'unseen knowledge' - information encoded in models but not directly observed during testing, leading to incomplete assessments of true model capacity.",
    "KnowSum framework provides a statistical method to quantify unseen knowledge by extrapolating from appearance frequencies of observed knowledge instances, offering more comprehensive evaluation than traditional approaches.",
    "The framework demonstrates utility across three critical applications: estimating total knowledge capacity, evaluating information retrieval effectiveness, and measuring output diversity in LLM responses.",
    "Experimental results show substantial volumes of knowledge are omitted when relying solely on observed LLM performance, indicating current benchmarks may be inadequate for proper model comparison.",
    "KnowSum produces significantly different comparative rankings for common LLMs based on their internal knowledge, suggesting current evaluation methodologies may be misleading practitioners about relative model capabilities."
