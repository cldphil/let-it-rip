    "OGGSplat introduces an open Gaussian growing method that enables 3D scene reconstruction from sparse views by expanding the field-of-view beyond the input view cone, addressing a critical limitation of existing generalizable approaches that struggle with regions outside input views.",
    "The method leverages semantic attributes of open Gaussians as strong priors for image extrapolation, enabling both semantic consistency and visual plausibility in reconstructed scenes through a novel RGB-semantic consistent inpainting module.",
    "The approach uses bidirectional control between an image diffusion model and a semantic diffusion model to inpaint selected rendered views, which are then lifted back into 3D space for efficient and progressive Gaussian parameter optimization.",
    "A new Gaussian Outpainting (GO) benchmark was established to evaluate methods that reconstruct regions outside the input view cone, providing a standardized evaluation framework for this specific problem domain.",
    "The method addresses computational efficiency concerns of per-scene optimization methods while overcoming the field-of-view limitations of generalizable approaches, making it suitable for applications requiring sparse input views like virtual reality and embodied AI."
