    "zip2zip enables dynamic vocabulary adaptation at inference time using Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression to merge co-occurring tokens into reusable hypertokens, reducing token sequence length and computational costs for domain-specific inputs.",
    "The framework consists of three components: an LZW-based tokenizer for incremental token merging, a runtime embedding layer for newly formed hypertokens, and a causal language modeling variant trained on compressed sequences.",
    "Existing LLMs can be converted to zip2zip-enabled models through parameter-efficient fine-tuning in just 10 GPU-hours, making the approach highly accessible for practical deployment.",
    "The method addresses the inefficiency of static tokenizers optimized on general corpora that fail to adapt to domain-specific or language-specific inputs, leading to unnecessarily long token sequences.",
    "zip2zip represents a novel approach to inference-time optimization that could significantly reduce computational costs for specialized applications while maintaining model performance through adaptive vocabulary management."
