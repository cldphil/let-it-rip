    "ReVisual-R1 achieves superior performance across multimodal reasoning benchmarks, with 53.6% accuracy on MathVerse, 48.8% on MathVision, and 89.2% on MATH500, outperforming existing open-source reasoning models like OpenVLThinker-7B and MM-Eureka-Qwen-7B by significant margins.",
    "The research identifies three crucial phenomena in current multimodal training pipelines that prevent effective complex reasoning activation, suggesting that direct application of reinforcement learning from textual models like Deepseek-R1 to multimodal models is insufficient without addressing these underlying issues.",
    "The proposed staged reinforcement learning approach with optimized cold start initialization provides a more effective training methodology for multimodal large language models compared to isolated RL application, demonstrating consistent improvements across both visual and textual reasoning tasks.",
    "The model shows strong cross-domain generalization, performing well on both multimodal benchmarks (MathVerse, MathVision, DynaMath, WeMath, LogicVista) and pure textual reasoning tasks (AIME24, AIME25, GPQA), indicating robust reasoning capabilities that transfer across modalities.",
    "The work provides a systematic analysis of why existing multimodal reasoning approaches fail and offers a principled solution through staged training, contributing both theoretical understanding and practical improvements to the field of multimodal AI reasoning."
