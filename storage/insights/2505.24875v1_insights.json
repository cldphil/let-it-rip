    "Although chain-of-thought reasoning and reinforcement learning (RL) have\ndriven breakthroughs in NLP, their integration into generative vision models\nremains underexplored. We introduce ReasonGen-R1, a two-stage framework that\nfirst imbues an autoregressive image generator with explicit text-based\n\"thinking\" skills via supervised fine-tuning on a newly generated reasoning\ndataset of written rationales, and then refines its outputs using Group\nRelative Policy Optimization. To enable the model to reason through text before\ngenerating images, We automatically generate and release a corpus of model\ncrafted rationales paired with visual prompts, enabling controlled planning of\nobject layouts, styles, and scene compositions. Our GRPO algorithm uses reward\nsignals from a pretrained vision language model to assess overall visual\nquality, optimizing the policy in each update.",
    "Evaluations on GenEval, DPG, and\nthe T2I benchmark demonstrate that ReasonGen-R1 consistently outperforms strong\nbaselines and prior state-of-the-art models. More: aka.ms/reasongen."
