    "ModuLM introduces a modular framework that enables flexible integration of different Large Language Models with various molecular structure encoders, addressing the challenge of benchmarking across an expanded model space in Molecular Relational Learning (MRL).",
    "The framework supports both flexible molecular input formats and dynamic architectural switching, allowing researchers to experiment with different combinations of LLMs and molecular encoders without redundant coding efforts.",
    "ModuLM provides a comprehensive suite of modules that can be mixed and matched to construct LLM-based models for understanding molecular pair interactions, which is critical for advancing biochemical research applications.",
    "The framework addresses the current gap where no existing LLM framework supports both multimodal molecular representations and modular architecture design, enabling fair model comparison across different approaches.",
    "By standardizing the integration process between LLMs and molecular encoders, ModuLM reduces development overhead and enables more systematic evaluation of different model combinations for molecular relational learning tasks."
