    "XGUARD introduces a 5-level graded safety evaluation framework (danger levels 0-4) that provides more nuanced assessment of LLM safety failures compared to binary safe/unsafe classifications, enabling better understanding of risk severity spectrum.",
    "The benchmark contains 3,840 red-teaming prompts sourced from real-world extremist content including social media and news data, covering diverse ideologically charged scenarios for comprehensive safety testing.",
    "Attack Severity Curve (ASC) visualization method enables interpretable comparison of LLM vulnerabilities and defense mechanisms across different threat intensities, providing actionable insights for safety improvements.",
    "Evaluation of six popular LLMs using XGUARD revealed significant safety gaps and quantified trade-offs between model robustness and expressive freedom, with two lightweight defense strategies tested for practical implementation.",
    "The graded evaluation approach demonstrates superior utility over binary classification for building trustworthy LLMs by identifying specific vulnerability patterns and enabling targeted safety interventions based on severity levels."
