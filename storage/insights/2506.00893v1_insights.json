    "The paper introduces a novel benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on affordance understanding - the ability to recognize action possibilities that objects provide to organisms, addressing a critical gap in current AI evaluation frameworks.",
    "The benchmark distinguishes between two types of affordances: Constitutive Affordances (inherent properties like a door being opened by its handle) and Transformative Affordances (creative uses like using objects as kindling or decorative materials), providing comprehensive evaluation coverage.",
    "The evaluation methodology uses multiple-choice questions with visual inputs, testing models' ability to identify both primary and alternative uses of objects, which is essential for practical AI applications in robotics and human-computer interaction.",
    "The benchmark includes complex scenarios requiring creative thinking, such as identifying that an object can serve as kindling, food for animals, craft materials, and gardening mulch simultaneously, testing multi-faceted reasoning capabilities.",
    "This work establishes a foundation for improving AI systems' understanding of object functionality beyond basic recognition, which is crucial for developing more capable autonomous agents and assistive technologies."
