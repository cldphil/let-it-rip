    "The paper proposes a selective Jacobi decoding technique to accelerate the inference of autoregressive normalizing flows, which are generative models that transform data variables to latent Gaussian variables through invertible neural networks.",
    "Empirical evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrated substantial speed improvements of up to 4.7 times faster inference compared to baseline methods, while maintaining generation quality and fidelity.",
    "The acceleration is achieved by selectively applying the Jacobi decoding process, which involves computing the Jacobian matrix determinant, only for a subset of dimensions during inference, reducing computational overhead.",
    "The proposed approach overcomes the architectural constraints of classical affine coupling layers in normalizing flows, which split the input into two parts and process them separately, limiting generation capabilities.",
    "The selective Jacobi decoding technique is a general acceleration method that can be applied to various autoregressive normalizing flow models, as demonstrated by the empirical evaluations across multiple datasets."
