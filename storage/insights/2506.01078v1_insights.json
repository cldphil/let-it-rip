    "GThinker introduces Cue-Rethinking, a novel reasoning pattern that grounds inferences in visual cues rather than relying solely on logic-based slow thinking strategies, addressing the fundamental limitation of current MLLMs in vision-centric reasoning tasks.",
    "Current leading Multimodal Large Language Models underperform on vision-centric multimodal reasoning because they predominantly use logic- and knowledge-based slow thinking strategies that fail to effectively integrate visual information during the reasoning process.",
    "The proposed approach excels across general scenarios, mathematics, and science by implementing a flexible reasoning pattern that can handle multiple plausible visual interpretations and inferences, moving beyond domain-specific optimization.",
    "GThinker addresses the critical gap where existing models fail to adequately ground visual cues, resulting in suboptimal performance when tasks require understanding and reasoning about visual content rather than pure logical deduction.",
    "The research demonstrates that effective multimodal reasoning requires a fundamental shift from text-centric reasoning approaches to vision-grounded inference patterns, with implications for developing more robust general-purpose multimodal AI systems."
