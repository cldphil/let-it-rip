    "DS-VTON introduces a dual-scale generation framework that separates garment alignment and texture preservation into two distinct stages - first generating low-resolution results for structural alignment, then using residual-guided diffusion to reconstruct high-resolution outputs with preserved fine-grained textures and patterns.",
    "The method adopts a fully mask-free generation paradigm that eliminates dependency on human parsing maps or segmentation masks by leveraging semantic priors from pretrained diffusion models, reducing errors from inaccurate masks and better preserving full-body appearance and geometry.",
    "The residual-guided diffusion process in the second stage specifically focuses on texture fidelity by refining the residual between low and high resolution scales, enabling better preservation of garment details while maintaining structural coherence established in the first stage.",
    "The framework uses a Reference U-Net architecture with cross-attention mechanisms and incorporates both garment and person images as inputs, with configurable ratio parameters (\u03c3, \u03b1, \u03b2) for controlling the generation process and balancing different input influences.",
    "Extensive validation on standard benchmarks VITON-HD and DressCode datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art performance both qualitatively and quantitatively, with the dual-scale approach proving more effective than single-stage methods for simultaneous alignment and texture preservation."
