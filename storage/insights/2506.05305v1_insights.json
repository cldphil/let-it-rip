    "ProRefine achieves 3-37 percentage point improvements over zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines on five mathematical reasoning datasets through inference-time prompt optimization using textual feedback from LLMs",
    "The method operates without requiring additional training or ground truth labels, making it highly practical for deployment as it dynamically refines prompts during inference using LLM-generated feedback",
    "ProRefine enables smaller models to match the performance of larger ones, providing significant cost savings and democratizing access to high-performing AI by reducing computational requirements",
    "The approach addresses critical error propagation issues in agentic workflows where multiple AI agents collaborate, improving reliability and scalability of multi-agent systems through better prompt design",
    "Developed through collaboration between Rochester Institute of Technology and Accenture's Center for Advanced AI, demonstrating industry-academic partnership in solving real-world AI deployment challenges"
