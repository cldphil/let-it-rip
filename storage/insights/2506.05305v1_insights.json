    "ProRefine achieves 3-37 percentage point improvements over zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks through inference-time prompt optimization using textual feedback from LLMs.",
    "The method operates without requiring additional training or ground truth labels, making it highly practical for deployment as it dynamically refines prompts during inference for multi-step reasoning tasks.",
    "ProRefine enables smaller language models to match the performance of larger ones, providing significant cost savings and democratizing access to high-performing AI systems in resource-constrained environments.",
    "The approach addresses critical error propagation issues in agentic workflows where multiple AI agents collaborate, improving reliability and scalability of complex multi-agent systems through better prompt design.",
    "Industry validation comes through collaboration between Rochester Institute of Technology and Accenture's Center for Advanced AI, demonstrating real-world applicability in enterprise AI deployment scenarios."
