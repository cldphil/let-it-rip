    "The paper proposes using atomic fact-checking to improve the reliability and explainability of medical question answering systems based on retrieval-augmented language models (RAG).",
    "Atomic facts are extracted from the generated responses and verified against retrieved evidence documents, with incorrect facts being rewritten using the correct information.",
    "The approach was evaluated on a medical question answering dataset, achieving high precision (0.92) and F1 score (0.86) in identifying incorrect facts.",
    "Applying atomic fact-checking led to improvements in the overall answer quality for 48% of the test cases, while causing deterioration in only 12% of cases.",
    "The method shows promise in increasing the factual correctness and transparency of complex medical question answering systems without requiring expensive retraining of large language models."
