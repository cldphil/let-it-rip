    "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit extensive medical knowledge but are\nprone to hallucinations and inaccurate citations, which pose a challenge to\ntheir clinical adoption and regulatory compliance. Current methods, such as\nRetrieval Augmented Generation, partially address these issues by grounding\nanswers in source documents, but hallucinations and low fact-level\nexplainability persist. In this work, we introduce a novel atomic fact-checking\nframework designed to enhance the reliability and explainability of LLMs used\nin medical long-form question answering. This method decomposes LLM-generated\nresponses into discrete, verifiable units called atomic facts, each of which is\nindependently verified against an authoritative knowledge base of medical\nguidelines. This approach enables targeted correction of errors and direct\ntracing to source literature, thereby improving the factual accuracy and\nexplainability of medical Q&A.",
    "Extensive evaluation using multi-reader\nassessments by medical experts and an automated open Q&A benchmark demonstrated\nsignificant improvements in factual accuracy and explainability.",
    "Our framework\nachieved up to a 40% overall answer improvement and a 50% hallucination\ndetection rate.",
    "The ability to trace each atomic fact back to the most relevant\nchunks from the database provides a granular, transparent explanation of the\ngenerated responses, addressing a major gap in current medical AI applications.\nThis work represents a crucial step towards more trustworthy and reliable\nclinical applications of LLMs, addressing key prerequisites for clinical\napplication and fostering greater confidence in AI-assisted healthcare."
