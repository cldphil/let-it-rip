    "MARS multimodal language model successfully combines text generation with nonverbal cue generation using vector-quantized representations, enabling more natural conversational AI that incorporates facial expressions and body language alongside dialogue.",
    "VENUS dataset provides large-scale annotated videos with time-aligned text, facial expressions, and body language from YouTube videos, offering 3D parameter annotations for training multimodal models that understand nonverbal communication patterns.",
    "Next-token prediction objective effectively trains models to generate both textual and nonverbal elements simultaneously within a unified framework, bridging the gap between language models and embodied conversational agents.",
    "Vector quantization technique enables discrete representation of continuous nonverbal behaviors, making it possible to integrate gesture and facial expression generation into standard language model architectures without major architectural changes.",
    "The approach demonstrates practical applications in virtual humans and gaming by enabling automatic generation of contextually appropriate nonverbal behaviors in 3D, potentially transforming human-computer interaction in entertainment and communication platforms."
