    "MLP layers are primarily responsible for memorization tasks in Transformers, while attention mechanisms handle retrieval operations, providing a clear functional separation that can guide architecture design decisions.",
    "The MixiT architecture with random, fixed attention coefficients matches fully trained Transformer performance on algorithmic tasks involving basic arithmetic and memorization, suggesting attention learning may be less critical than previously thought.",
    "Freezing either MLP layers or attention projectors (queries and keys) at initialization while training other components reveals which parts of the architecture are essential for specific task types, enabling more efficient training strategies.",
    "Input-dependent attention computation can be eliminated without significant performance loss on certain algorithmic tasks, potentially reducing computational overhead and simplifying model architectures for specific applications.",
    "The research provides a framework for disentangling Transformer components that could lead to more efficient model designs, targeted training approaches, and better understanding of which architectural elements to prioritize for different use cases."
