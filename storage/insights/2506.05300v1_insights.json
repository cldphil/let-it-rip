    "SiftAttention replaces computationally expensive top-k operations with efficient element-wise filtering based on threshold values, addressing GPU performance bottlenecks in attention computations that arise from poor top-k operation performance on GPU architectures.",
    "The method exploits a novel empirical observation that the \u03c4-th quantile of attention scores follows a predictable power-law distribution over sequential generation steps, enabling dynamic threshold estimation per prompt at each generation step without requiring expensive sorting operations.",
    "SiftAttention reduces memory bandwidth usage by selectively loading only attention scores above the computed threshold and their corresponding value vectors, minimizing data movement between High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and SRAM during inference.",
    "The approach preserves model quality better than existing approximate attention methods while achieving computational efficiency gains, making it suitable for production deployment of large language models where inference speed and memory efficiency are critical.",
    "The power-law guided dynamic sifting approach represents a novel paradigm for approximate attention that leverages statistical properties of attention distributions rather than relying on traditional sparsity patterns or fixed pruning strategies."
