    "SiftAttention replaces expensive top-k operations with computationally efficient element-wise filtering based on threshold values, addressing GPU performance bottlenecks in attention computations that arise from poor top-k operation performance on GPU architectures.",
    "The method exploits a novel empirical observation that the \u03c4-th quantile of attention scores follows a predictable power-law distribution over sequential generation steps, enabling dynamic threshold estimation per prompt at each generation step without requiring expensive sorting operations.",
    "SiftAttention reduces memory bandwidth usage by selectively loading only attention scores above the dynamically estimated threshold and their corresponding value vectors, minimizing data movement between High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and SRAM during attention computations.",
    "The approach preserves model quality better than existing approximate attention methods while providing computational efficiency gains, making it suitable for deployment in memory-bandwidth-constrained GPU inference scenarios for large language models.",
    "The power-law guided dynamic sifting approach represents a novel paradigm for approximate attention that leverages statistical properties of attention score distributions rather than relying on computationally expensive ranking operations, opening new directions for efficient transformer inference."
