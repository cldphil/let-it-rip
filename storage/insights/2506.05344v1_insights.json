  "key_findings": [
    "Only approximately 5% of attention heads in MLLMs actively contribute to visual understanding, termed 'visual heads', revealing extreme sparsity in visual processing that can be exploited for optimization.",
    "SparseMM introduces a training-free framework that quantifies head-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis, enabling efficient identification of visual heads without requiring model retraining.",
    "The KV-Cache optimization strategy allocates asymmetric computation budgets based on visual scores, achieving 1.38x real-time acceleration and 52% memory reduction during generation while maintaining accuracy.",
    "Unlike prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore visual particularities, SparseMM specifically prioritizes and retains visual semantics during decoding, leading to superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.",
    "The approach demonstrates that visual processing in MLLMs can be significantly optimized by leveraging the inherent sparsity of attention mechanisms, opening new directions for efficient multimodal inference."
