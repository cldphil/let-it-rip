  "key_findings": [
    "Only approximately 5% of attention heads in MLLMs actively contribute to visual understanding, termed 'visual heads', revealing extreme sparsity in visual processing that can be exploited for optimization without significant performance loss.",
    "SparseMM introduces a training-free framework that quantifies head-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis, enabling efficient identification of visual heads without requiring model retraining or fine-tuning.",
    "The SparseMM KV-Cache optimization strategy achieves 1.38x real-time acceleration and 52% memory reduction during generation while maintaining performance by allocating asymmetric computation budgets based on visual head scores.",
    "Unlike prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore visual particularities, SparseMM specifically prioritizes and retains visual semantics during decoding, making it particularly suitable for multimodal applications.",
    "The approach demonstrates superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs across mainstream multimodal benchmarks, suggesting that understanding attention head specialization can lead to significant computational savings in production MLLM deployments."

  "limitations": [
    "Limited to approximately 5% visual head identification which may not generalize across all MLLM architectures or visual tasks",
    "Performance evaluation limited to mainstream benchmarks may not capture edge cases or specialized visual understanding tasks"
