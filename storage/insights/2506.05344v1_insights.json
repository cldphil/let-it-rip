    "Only approximately 5% of attention heads in MLLMs actively contribute to visual understanding, termed 'visual heads', revealing extreme sparsity in visual processing that can be exploited for optimization.",
    "SparseMM introduces a training-free framework that quantifies head-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis, enabling efficient identification of visual heads without requiring model retraining.",
    "The KV-Cache optimization strategy achieves 1.38x real-time acceleration and 52% memory reduction during generation while maintaining performance by allocating asymmetric computation budgets based on visual scores.",
    "Unlike prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore visual particularities, SparseMM prioritizes retaining visual semantics during decoding by focusing computational resources on visually-relevant attention heads.",
    "Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal benchmarks demonstrate superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, suggesting this approach can be broadly applied to existing MLLM deployments for immediate performance gains."
