    "Only approximately 5% of attention heads in MLLMs actively contribute to visual understanding, termed 'visual heads', revealing extreme sparsity in visual processing that can be exploited for optimization without significant performance loss.",
    "SparseMM introduces a training-free framework that quantifies head-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis, enabling efficient identification of visual heads without requiring model retraining or fine-tuning.",
    "The SparseMM KV-Cache optimization strategy achieves 1.38x real-time acceleration and 52% memory reduction during generation while maintaining performance by allocating asymmetric computation budgets based on visual head scores.",
    "The approach leverages sparsity patterns specific to multimodal models, unlike prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore visual processing particularities, making it specifically optimized for MLLM inference scenarios.",
    "Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal benchmarks demonstrate superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, suggesting this sparsity-based approach could be widely applicable to various MLLM architectures and deployment scenarios."
