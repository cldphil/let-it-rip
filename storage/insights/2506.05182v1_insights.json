    "GPT-4o achieves only 56% accuracy on multi-structured financial documents when processing PDFs directly, indicating significant challenges with complex document structures like nested tables and multi-dimensional plots.",
    "Pre-processing tools significantly improve LLM performance, raising GPT-4o accuracy from 56% to 61.3% and GPT-4 accuracy to 76%, while also reducing overall processing costs.",
    "Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently produce hallucinations and erroneous outputs when interpreting intricately structured information in financial documents, highlighting the need for specialized preprocessing approaches.",
    "Industrial and open-source preprocessing tools can be effectively integrated into a pipeline to enhance LLM comprehension of hybrid data sources including PDF documents and web pages with complex structures.",
    "The research demonstrates that traditional text-based LLMs like GPT-4 can outperform newer multi-modal models like GPT-4o on structured financial document tasks when proper preprocessing is applied, suggesting preprocessing may be more critical than multi-modal capabilities for this domain."
