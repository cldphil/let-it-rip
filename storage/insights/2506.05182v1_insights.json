    "GPT-4o achieves only 56% accuracy on multi-structured financial documents when processing PDFs directly, indicating significant challenges with complex document layouts including nested tables and multi-dimensional plots.",
    "Pre-processing tools significantly improve LLM performance, boosting GPT-4o accuracy from 56% to 61.3% and GPT-4 to 76%, while simultaneously reducing overall processing costs.",
    "Industrial and open-source pre-processing pipelines can effectively extract and structure complex financial document elements, making them more interpretable for standard LLMs compared to relying solely on multi-modal capabilities.",
    "The study demonstrates that structured data extraction preprocessing is more effective than direct multi-modal processing for financial documents, suggesting a hybrid approach combining document parsing tools with LLMs.",
    "Current MLLMs still struggle with intricate document structures leading to hallucinations and errors, but systematic preprocessing can mitigate these issues while providing cost benefits in production environments."
