    "AutoSEP framework enables fully unsupervised improvement of multimodal LLM performance on fine-grained image classification by leveraging unlabeled data through iterative self-supervised prompt learning, addressing the challenge of distinguishing visually similar subcategories.",
    "The method uses unlabeled data to automatically learn description prompts that guide MLLMs to identify crucial discriminative features within images, eliminating the need for manual prompt engineering or labeled training data.",
    "AutoSEP employs an iterative self-enhancing approach that progressively refines prompts to focus on subtle visual details that are critical for fine-grained classification tasks, which standard MLLMs typically overlook without explicit guidance.",
    "The framework operates in a zero-shot setting while still improving performance through self-supervision, making it practical for domains where labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain, particularly in specialized fine-grained classification scenarios.",
    "This approach demonstrates that unlabeled data can be effectively utilized to enhance MLLM capabilities for specialized visual tasks, opening possibilities for improving model performance in domain-specific applications without requiring extensive labeled datasets."
