    "IRT-Router introduces a novel multi-LLM routing framework that applies Item Response Theory from psychology to optimize the balance between LLM performance and cost by intelligently routing queries to the most suitable model based on query difficulty and model capabilities.",
    "The framework explicitly models the relationship between LLM capabilities and user query attributes, enabling accurate prediction of response performance while providing interpretable insights about individual LLM abilities and query difficulty levels.",
    "IRT-Router addresses the critical trade-off in LLM deployment where powerful models deliver better results but at high cost, while smaller models are cost-effective but less capable, by creating an intelligent routing mechanism.",
    "The system incorporates an online learning component that allows for continuous adaptation and improvement of routing decisions based on real-world performance feedback and changing query patterns.",
    "The approach provides interpretability advantages over black-box routing methods by offering clear insights into why specific routing decisions are made, which is crucial for enterprise deployment and debugging."
