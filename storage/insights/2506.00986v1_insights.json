    "The study developed an LLM-based smart assistant using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach that enables natural language querying of humanities databases, specifically tested on the Prozhito digital archive containing 20th century diary entries from Russian-speaking individuals.",
    "The system integrates multiple advanced technologies including hybrid search capabilities, automatic query generation, text-to-SQL filtering for structured data access, semantic database search for contextual understanding, and automatic hyperlink insertion for enhanced navigation.",
    "The chatbot is specifically designed to serve both specialist researchers in anthropology and history as well as non-specialist users without requiring prior technical training, demonstrating accessibility across different user expertise levels.",
    "The assistant addresses critical limitations in traditional humanities database interaction formats, particularly improving search methodologies and response generation quality compared to conventional database query interfaces.",
    "Experiments were conducted to evaluate response quality across various language models, suggesting the system provides measurable improvements in user interaction with digital humanities archives, though specific performance metrics are not detailed in the provided excerpt."

  "limitations": [
    "Testing appears limited to a single database (Prozhito archive) which may limit generalizability to other humanities databases",
