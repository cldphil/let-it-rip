    "We propose a new method for estimating how much a model ``knows'' about a\ndatapoint and use it to measure the capacity of modern language models. Prior\nstudies of language model memorization have struggled to disentangle\nmemorization from generalization. We formally separate memorization into two\ncomponents: \\textit{unintended memorization}, the information a model contains\nabout a specific dataset, and \\textit{generalization}, the information a model\ncontains about the true data-generation process. When we completely eliminate\ngeneralization, we can compute the total memorization, which provides an\nestimate of model capacity: our measurements estimate that GPT-style models\nhave a capacity of approximately 3.6 bits per parameter. We train language\nmodels on datasets of increasing size and observe that models memorize until\ntheir capacity fills, at which point ``grokking'' begins, and unintended\nmemorization decreases as models begin to generalize. We train hundreds of\ntransformer language models ranging from $500K$ to $1.5B$ parameters and\nproduce a series of scaling laws relating model capacity and data size to\nmembership inference."
