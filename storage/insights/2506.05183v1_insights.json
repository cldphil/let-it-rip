    "TreeRPO introduces a novel tree sampling approach to estimate mathematical expectations of rewards at intermediate reasoning steps, eliminating the need for separate step reward models that existing RLVR methods require.",
    "The method builds upon Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by computing rewards based on step-level groups generated during tree sampling, providing more granular feedback than trajectory-level rewards.",
    "TreeRPO generates fine-grained and dense reward signals throughout the reasoning process, significantly enhancing LLM learning compared to methods that only provide rewards at the end of complete trajectories.",
    "The approach directly estimates step-level rewards through the sampling process itself, reducing architectural complexity by removing the dependency on external reward models while maintaining training effectiveness.",
    "The method addresses a fundamental limitation in current RLVR approaches where sparse, trajectory-level rewards provide insufficient guidance for optimizing intermediate reasoning steps in complex problem-solving tasks."
