    "EOC-Bench introduces a novel benchmark with 3,277 meticulously annotated QA pairs categorized into Past, Present, and Future temporal categories, enabling systematic evaluation of object-centric embodied cognition in dynamic egocentric scenarios.",
    "The benchmark covers 11 fine-grained evaluation dimensions and 3 visual object referencing types, providing comprehensive assessment of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in real-world interactive environments.",
    "A mixed-format human-in-the-loop annotation framework with four types of questions was developed to ensure thorough assessment of dynamic object understanding capabilities.",
    "A novel multi-scale temporal accuracy metric was designed specifically for open-ended temporal evaluation, addressing the gap in existing static scene exploration benchmarks.",
    "The research addresses critical limitations in existing embodied benchmarks that focus primarily on static scenes while neglecting dynamic changes from user interactions in cluttered environments."
