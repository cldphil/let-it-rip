    "The paper proposes a framework to evaluate the confidence of large language models (LLMs) in using epistemic markers (e.g. 'fairly certain', 'undoubtedly') to convey uncertainty in their responses.",
    "The marker confidence is calculated as the accuracy of answers containing a specific marker, evaluated across multiple models and datasets.",
    "Results show that while markers perform well on in-distribution data, their stability declines for out-of-distribution contexts.",
    "More powerful LLM models demonstrate better understanding and usage of epistemic markers compared to smaller models.",
    "An example shows that for the marker 'fairly certain' on the StrategyQA dataset, GPT-4 had a marker confidence of around 64.52%, getting 20 out of 31 responses correct."
