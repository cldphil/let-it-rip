    "Code language models internally represent programming languages through a hierarchical neuron structure where language-specific neurons concentrate in bottom layers while language-exclusive neurons appear in top layers, enabling better understanding of model architecture for code generation optimization.",
    "During few-shot translation tasks across 21 programming language pairs using Llama-based models, the concept space converges toward English representations in the second half of intermediate layers, assigning high probabilities to English tokens which can inform prompt engineering strategies.",
    "Programming languages with larger keyword sets and high alignment with multiple other languages are positioned closer to the model's core concept space regardless of input/output language pairs, suggesting these languages serve as better intermediary representations for cross-language code translation.",
    "The study demonstrates that neuron activation analysis across 11 programming languages reveals distinct patterns where highly-aligned languages make language-specific neuron identification infeasible, indicating shared computational pathways that can be leveraged for multi-language code understanding.",
    "The research provides a framework for analyzing how LLMs internally represent programming languages through embedding decoding and neuron activation analysis, offering insights for improving code model training and fine-tuning strategies for specific programming language tasks."
