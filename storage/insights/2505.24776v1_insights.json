    "The proposed approach constructs a random mask-based diffusion and denoising process to generate diverse and high-quality equations for symbolic regression.",
    "It integrates the generative process with a token-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) method to conduct efficient reinforcement learning on the given measurement dataset.",
    "A long short-term risk-seeking policy is introduced to expand the pool of top-performing candidates, further enhancing performance.",
    "Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",
    "The approach explores an open-ended space, dynamically adjusting the number, order, and type of parameters and operations, unlike traditional machine learning with fixed model architectures."
