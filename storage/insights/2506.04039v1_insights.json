    "Entity-centric Multimodal Preference Optimization (EMPO) addresses hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models by focusing on modality alignment rather than just human preference alignment, targeting the root cause of over-reliance on text-based reasoning.",
    "The research identifies two critical hallucination patterns: Visual Neglect where models generate image-agnostic responses when visual input is crucial, and modality misalignment between image and text processing that leads to unreliable outputs.",
    "Automatic construction of high-quality preference data across three dimensions (image, instruction, and response) using open-source instruction datasets provides a scalable solution to overcome the scarcity of multimodal preference training data.",
    "The approach demonstrates measurable improvements in similarity scores and success rates at different similarity thresholds, indicating enhanced multimodal understanding and reduced hallucination rates in vision-language tasks.",
    "The study reveals that existing preference alignment methods inadequately address the fundamental issue of modality misalignment, leading to continued over-reliance on LLM backbones and persistent hallucination problems in real-world multimodal applications."
