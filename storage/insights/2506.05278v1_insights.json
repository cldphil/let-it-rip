    "MICRO-ACT framework addresses knowledge conflicts in RAG systems by using hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context complexity and decomposes knowledge sources into fine-grained comparisons, achieving consistent significant increases in QA accuracy across 5 benchmark datasets and 3 conflict types.",
    "The decomposition action is the most critical component, with its removal causing over 20% performance drop, as it dynamically adjusts input granularity for other actions and enables iterative refinement until optimal granularity is achieved.",
    "Traditional side-by-side knowledge comparison approaches overwhelm LLMs with extraneous or lengthy contexts, while MICRO-ACT's actionable step representation enables reasoning beyond superficial context by pinpointing fine-grained conflict points.",
    "The framework uses a hierarchical action space with navigational and functional actions that operate most effectively when input granularity is properly managed through the decomposition component, demonstrating that action effectiveness heavily depends on appropriate input granularity.",
    "MICRO-ACT successfully mitigates the fundamental problem where retrieved external knowledge contradicts LLMs' inherent parametric knowledge, providing a systematic approach to handle knowledge conflicts that adversely affect downstream QA task performance."
