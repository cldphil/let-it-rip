    "Introduces dual score matching framework that combines traditional denoising score matching with a novel secondary objective based on gradients with respect to noise level, achieving state-of-the-art cross-entropy values on ImageNet64 dataset for normalized energy models.",
    "Modifies existing score network architectures from diffusion models to compute energy functions while preserving their inductive biases, enabling direct computation of normalized log probabilities without expensive partition function estimation.",
    "Demonstrates that energy networks trained with dual score matching show strong generalization capabilities, suggesting the approach learns robust probability density representations that transfer well across different contexts.",
    "Provides a practical solution to the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional probability modeling by leveraging the architectural innovations and training stability of diffusion models while producing normalized energy functions.",
    "Establishes a bridge between generative diffusion models and energy-based models, potentially enabling practitioners to leverage advances in diffusion model architectures for explicit density modeling applications."
