    "Introduces dual score matching framework that combines traditional denoising score matching with a novel secondary objective based on gradients with respect to noise level, achieving state-of-the-art cross-entropy values on ImageNet64 dataset for normalized energy models.",
    "Modifies existing score network architectures from diffusion models to compute energy functions while preserving their inductive biases, enabling direct computation of normalized log probabilities without requiring expensive partition function estimation.",
    "Demonstrates that energy networks trained with dual score matching show strong generalization capabilities, suggesting the approach learns meaningful probability distributions rather than overfitting to training data.",
    "Provides a practical solution to the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional probability modeling by leveraging the architectural innovations and training stability of diffusion models for energy-based modeling.",
    "Establishes a bridge between diffusion generative models and energy-based models, potentially enabling practitioners to apply diffusion model techniques to density estimation tasks where normalized probabilities are required."
