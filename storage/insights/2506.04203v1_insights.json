    "CASCADIA achieves up to 4x lower latency deadlines and up to 5x higher system throughput compared to standalone LLMs by using a bi-level optimization approach that routes simple queries to smaller models and complex ones to larger models.",
    "The system employs mixed-integer linear programming at the inner level for resource allocation and request routing optimization, enabling efficient handling of varying resource demands across different LLM sizes.",
    "CASCADIA demonstrates 2.8x average improvement in latency deadlines and 3x average improvement in throughput across multiple traces, with the system achieving 95% SLO attainment at significantly lower SLO scales than standalone solutions.",
    "The framework addresses three critical challenges in LLM serving: huge and varying resource demands of different LLMs, inherent heterogeneity of LLM workloads, and co-optimization of system deployment and routing strategy.",
    "The cascade serving approach enables quality-preserving LLM serving by intelligently balancing the latency-quality trade-off, allowing organizations to maintain high output quality while significantly reducing response times and increasing system capacity."
