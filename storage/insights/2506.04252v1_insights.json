    "CircuGraphRAG framework combines retrieval-augmented generation with domain-specific knowledge graphs to ground LLM outputs in verified industrial data, reducing hallucination of industrial codes and emission factors that undermine regulatory compliance and investment decisions in circular economy applications.",
    "The framework specifically addresses the critical problem of LLMs generating incorrect industrial codes and emission factors, which can lead to flawed regulatory compliance assessments and poor investment decisions in sustainable manufacturing contexts.",
    "Knowledge graph integration enables the system to retrieve and validate industrial data before generation, ensuring that LLM outputs are grounded in accurate, domain-specific information rather than potentially hallucinated content.",
    "The approach targets sustainable manufacturing decision-making by providing reliable AI-assisted analysis of circular economy scenarios, potentially improving the accuracy of environmental impact assessments and resource optimization strategies.",
    "The research demonstrates the application of RAG frameworks to specialized industrial domains, showing how domain-specific knowledge graphs can enhance LLM reliability for critical business and regulatory applications in sustainability contexts."
