    "SocialEval introduces a novel dual evaluation paradigm for Large Language Models' social intelligence, combining outcome-oriented goal achievement evaluation with process-oriented interpersonal ability assessment through script-based narrative scenarios.",
    "The benchmark uses a world tree structure for each script that contains plot lines driven by interpersonal abilities, providing comprehensive evaluation of how LLMs navigate complex social interactions in realistic scenarios.",
    "Experimental results demonstrate that current LLMs significantly underperform compared to humans on both outcome-oriented and process-oriented social intelligence evaluations, revealing substantial gaps in AI social reasoning capabilities.",
    "The framework is implemented as a bilingual benchmark, enabling cross-cultural evaluation of social intelligence and addressing the need for culturally-aware AI systems in global deployment scenarios.",
    "The research establishes a new standard for evaluating AI social capabilities beyond traditional NLP metrics, focusing on practical social goal achievement and interpersonal skill demonstration that directly impacts real-world AI deployment."
