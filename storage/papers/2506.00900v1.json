It is essen-\ntial for maintaining interpersonal relationships by\nbuilding trust (Goleman, 2005), resolving conflicts\n(Salovey and Mayer, 1990), promoting collabora-\ntion (Woolley et al., 2010), thus effectively navi-\ngating complex social dynamics (Carnegie, 2024).\nDriven by the fast development of large language\nmodels (LLMs, Touvron et al. 2023a,b), more and\nmore research has reported the emergence of SI\nin LLMs through society simulations (Park et al.,\n2023), where social dynamics among interacting\n*Equal contribution.\n1Data: https://github.com/thu-coai/SocialEval\nP r o s e l fCompetition\nA n t i s o c i a lInductionConflict\nP r o s o c i a lCooperationAssistanceNegotiationAltruismSocial W orld T axonomy\nQiang Li: \nGang MemberWei Liu: \nPoliceMing Qin: Target of BullyingGoal: Escape Bullying SafelyProtagonistBrother Feng, Gao, \nZhuang: BullyYuanxin Luo: \nTeacherYun Qin: \nFatherMing Qin is a student who has just entered middle school.

This sparks the com-\nmunity’s strong interest in using LLMs to study\nsocial science (Liu et al., 2024), train people to\nhandle interpersonal situations (Lin et al., 2024),\nand many more. However, a fundamental question\nwhose answer measures the validity of existing re-\nsearch in this line has not received enough attention:\nhow can we thoroughly evaluate an LLM’s SI and\nrecognize its discrepancy from humans’?\nSocial psychology theories suggest that humans’\nSI manifests in a dynamic process, which is a con-\n--- Page 2 ---\ntinuous adaptation of interpersonal skills within\nevolving narrative-like social activities that can be\nnaturally organized as “scripts” (Schank and Abel-\nson, 2013). As shown in Figure 1, the protagonist’s\ninitial confrontation ( Episode 1 ) informs his subse-\nquent decision to seek a solution from his teacher\n(Episode 2 ), which then shapes his institutional\nresponse ( Episode 3 ). Each decision transits cur-\nrent episode to the next, forming an interdependent\nsequence that moves toward distinct social goals\n(e.g., escaping bullying ) while realized via inter-\npersonal skills (e.g., persuasive skill ) (Bandura,\n1986; Goffman et al., 2002). This process naturally\npresents an operational evaluation paradigm for\nboth humans and machines: 1) Outcome-oriented\nevaluation of goal achievement within social activ-\nities and 2) Process-oriented evaluation of inter-\npersonal abilities towards goal pursuit .\nExisting related works (Zhou et al., 2023b; Wang\net al., 2024; Mou et al., 2024) still fail to meet this\nparadigm due to two serious issues, hindering a\nholistic SI evaluation: 1) Limited on single-episode\nsocial dynamics, ignoring how SI is reflected in se-\nquentially dependent episodes; 2) Focus only on\nterminal goal achievement, lacking fine-grained in-\nteractive process design for evaluating goal pursuit.\nDrawing on social psychology theories (Schank\nand Abelson, 2013; Goffman et al., 2002), we pro-\npose SOCIAL EVAL, a script-based bilingual bench-\nmark designed to evaluate and inspect LLMs’ SI.\nIt integrates process- and outcome-oriented evalua-\ntions by manually crafted narrative scripts, provid-\ning a comprehensive view of how LLMs navigate\nthrough social interactions. As shown in Figure\n1, each script constitutes a social world, presented\nby multiple plot lines with interconnected episode\nsequences. At each critical juncture in a plot’s pro-\ngression, we craft options exhibiting interpersonal\nabilities that lead to distinct episode transitions,\nand thus subsequent diverging endings. The plot\nlines intertwine via episode transitions to form a\ntree-like social world, so we call it the “world tree”.\nWith SOCIAL EVAL, we thoroughly evaluate and\ninspect LLMs’ SI via: 1) Comprehensive social\nworld constructions . Drawing on interdependence\ntheory (Kihlstrom and Cantor, 2000), we compile\na rich set of prototypical narrative-like social ac-\ntivities to define our social world taxonomy (§2.1),\nwhich includes 3 categories across 7 sub-categories\n(Figure 1). 2) Outcome-oriented evaluation . We\nmanually craft 153 world trees according to the\ntaxonomy (§3), each featuring plot lines markedby goal achievement indicators, presented via di-\nalogues among a protagonist and other characters.\nThe tested LLM plays the protagonist and selects\noptions, which are presented as candidate utter-\nances and exhibit interpersonal abilities, to transit\nthe episode towards achieving social goals (§4.1).\nThis explicit navigation process supports investi-\ngating possible behavioral discrepancies between\nLLMs and humans (§4.2). 3) Process-oriented\nevaluation . To test whether LLM can correctly\nuse the abilities in the options for goal pursuit , we\nmanually craft probing questions and plausible yet\nmisleading options reflecting wrong abilities, form-\ning multiple-choice questions (§4.1). Notably, this\nsetup support delves deeper into LLMs’ represen-\ntation spaces and neuronal activations, examining\nwhether LLMs’ interpersonal abilities are stored in\nspecific functional groups, akin to the human brain\n(§4.3). Each option forms a test sample. 153 world\ntrees produce 2,493 test samples, covering 5 inter-\npersonal ability aspects and 32 specific abilities.\nTo the best of our knowledge, SOCIAL EVAL is\nthe first script-based bilingual SI benchmark. Upon\nit, we perform outcome-oriented goal achievement\nevaluation and process-oriented interpersonal abil-\nity evaluation of both LLMs and humans. Re-\nsults reveal that LLMs fall behind humans in both\nSI evaluations, while both of them exhibit cross-\nlinguistic differences in SI. We find that exist-\ning LLMs show strong preferences over prosocial\nand positive behaviors, even when such behaviors\nmay ultimately lead to goal failure. By inspecting\nLLMs’ formed representations and neuronal acti-\nvations regarding interpersonal abilities, we unveil\nthat with growing model size, LLMs gradually de-\nvelop ability-specific functional partitions, similar\nto those found in the human brain (Li et al., 2024b).\n2 Preliminaries\n2.1 Social World Taxonomy\nSI enables individuals to behave wisely in social in-\nteractions by considering how their own and others’\nbehaviors would influence immediate and future\noutcomes for all involved. The outcomes are often\nreflected in individual social goals that shape one’s\ninterpersonal orientations, essentially the ways of\ninteracting with others, and ultimately guide social\nbehaviors (Kihlstrom and Cantor, 2000). Along\nthis theory, the orientations are divided by out-\ncome transformations, which reflect the flow of\ninterests between oneself and others, classifying so-\n--- Page 3 ---\ncial worlds into prosocial ,proself , and antisocial .\nBased on this interest flow to extend this theory,\nwe refine these orientations by defining outcome as\na set constructed by self-interest and altruism, i.e.,\noutcome = (self-interest, altruism) :\n•Self-interest : the desire of pursuing personal\ngains, with values [1, 0, -1] being the strong\npursuit of self-interest, balancing personal and\nothers’ interests, sacrificing personal interests.\n•Altruism : the desire of prioritizing others’ inter-\nests, with values [1, 0, -1] being strong prioritiza-\ntion of others’ interests, balancing personal and\nothers’ interests, neglecting others’ interests.\nVia Cartesian product, we obtain 9 orientations:\ncooperation (1,1), negotiation (1,0), competition\n(1,-1), assistance (0,1), chitchat (0,0), induction\n(0,-1), altruism (-1,1), withdrawal (-1,0), conflict\n(-1,-1). As chitchat lacks clear social goals and\nwithdrawal is rare, we exclude them, leaving 7 ori-\nentations in our taxonomy. Detailed explanations\nare provided in Appendix A.1.\n2.2 Interpersonal Ability Inventory\nInterpersonal ability enables individuals to navi-\ngate social dynamics for goal pursuit. We adopt the\nBESSI (Behavioral, Emotional, and Social Skills\nInventory), a psychological framework (Soto et al.,\n2022) that integrates comprehensive interpersonal\nabilities, as our inventory for SI evaluation. The\nframework includes 5 aspects covering 32 specific\nabilities: (1) Social Engagement (5 abilities): ac-\ntively engaging with others. (2) Cooperation (5\nabilities): maintaining positive social relationships.\n(3) Self-Management (12 abilities): effectively\npursuing social goals and completing social tasks.\n(4) Emotional Resilience (5 abilities): regulating\nemotions and moods. (5) Innovation (5 abilities):\nengaging with novel ideas and experiences. Details\non the 32 abilities are provided in Appendix A.2.\n2.3 Evaluation Task Formulation\nWe examine LLMs’ SI by investigating their nav-\nigation in the world trees to achieve desired so-\ncial goals. Each world tree can be formalized as a\ngoal-conditioned Markov Decision Process (Kael-\nbling et al., 1998) with the 4-tuple (S,A,T,R),\nwhere Sis the state space, Ais the action space,\nT:S × A → S is the transition function, and\nR:S × A → R∈ {0,1}is the reward function.\nTask 1: Outcome-oriented Goal Achievement\nEvaluation This task is defined as implementinga function FT,R:S × A → S × R, which maps a\ngiven state and action (i.e., st,at) to the subsequent\nstate and a goal achievement reward (i.e., st+1,\nrt+1). Here, the state stis the current episode Et\nin which the player is located in the world tree,\ni.e.,st=Et. The action atis the protagonist’s\nnext utterance utfrom action space Atthat links\nthe subsequent episode Et+1and reflects specific\ninterpersonal abilities for the episode transition,\ni.e.,at∈ A t={ut,1, ..., u t,m}. Thus, we define\ninterpersonal ability-driven episode transition as:\nst+1=Et+1=FT(st, at). (1)\nAfter that, we assess LLMs’ goal achievement by:\nrt+1=FR(st+1), (2)\nwhere rt+1= 1indicates the social goal has been\nachieved; otherwise, rt+1= 0.\nTask 2: Process-oriented Interpersonal Abil-\nity Evaluation For each candidate utterance ut,i\nfrom action space At={ut,1, ..., u t,m}of state\nst,i∈[1, m], which showcases specific interper-\nsonal abilities, we construct tailored questions Qt,i\nto probe these abilities, along with several incor-\nrect but misleading distractor utterances ud\nt,i=\n{ud\nt,i,1, ..., ud\nt,i,k}. Thus, this task is defined as\na function FR:S ×Q×Uk+1→ U × Rthat maps\nfrom the given state st, question Qt,i, and set of\nutterance options Ut,i={ut,i}∪ud\nt,ito the selected\nutterance u, we assess LLMs’ interpersonal ability:\nu, r=FR(st,Qt,i,Ut,i), (3)\nwhere r= 1denotes selected utterance ucorrectly\nreflects the intended abilities, otherwise, r= 0.\n3 S OCIAL EVAL Collection\n3.1 World Tree Construction\nWe hire screenwriters to manually craft world trees,\nand the components of a world tree are as follows.\nCharacters involved in each world tree are di-\nvided into a protagonist and several supporting\ncharacters, with the protagonist serving as the cen-\ntral figure who drives plots’ progression via in-\nteractions with others. Each character is set with\nmanually crafted information: 1) Public profile is\nthe details known to others, e.g., identity, experi-\nences, and social relationships. 2) Private profile\ncontains information known only to the character.\n--- Page 4 ---\n3) Social goals represent the outcomes each charac-\nter strives to achieve, shaping the orientation of the\nsocial world and influencing their decisions while\nnavigating in the world tree. Social goals are also\ninvisible to other characters.\nScenarios serve as the root of world trees for\nplot progression, providing background of the so-\ncial worlds. We adopt freely created interactive\nvideos from platforms like BiliBili and YouTube as\nreferences for crafting scenarios tailored to social\nworlds with specific orientations.\nEpisodes are composed of dialogue interactions\nbetween characters. In a world tree, multiple in-\nterconnected episodes often involve transitions in\nsocial situations, changes in social relationships,\nand shifts in dialogue topics, shaping plots that\nclosely mirror real-world social dynamics.\nEpisode Transitions occur at critical junctures\nin the developing plot, driving the progression of\nepisodes. At each transition, multiple candidate\nutterances reflecting distinct interpersonal abilities\nare crafted for the protagonist to choose, each creat-\ning distinct subsequent plot lines. 32 interpersonal\nabilities are involved in these transitions. To evalu-\nate them, we craft tailored questions to probe the\nabilities embodied in the candidate utterances. The\nquestions follow the psychological definitions of\nthe specific abilities and are consistent with the\ncurrent episode. We also introduce distracting ut-\nterances, which are carefully crafted to be plausible\nyet incorrect, avoiding easy dismissal. These dis-\ntractors, alongside the correct utterance, form the\nchoice set for each question. Each candidate ut-\nterance produces a unique test case, comprising\nthe current episode, question, and choice set for\nprocess-oriented interpersonal ability evaluation.\nPlot Ending is the final outcome of a plot line.\nFor each plot line in a world tree, we manually craft\na reasonable and logical ending that follows the\nsequence of episode transitions. These plot endings\nare annotated to indicate whether the protagonist\nsuccessfully achieves their social goals, used for\noutcome-oriented goal achievement evaluation.\n3.2 Quality Control of S OCIAL EVAL\nWe employ a dedicated team of quality inspectors\nwho are trained in inspection guidelines as follows:\n1) Orientation feasibility : whether the character\nprofiles and scenario settings match the intendedorientation of a social world. 2) Plot reasonable-\nness and coherence : whether the progression of\nplots driven by character dialogues, episode tran-\nsitions, and plot endings are logical and coherent\nthroughout. 3) Annotation accuracy : whether the\ninterpersonal abilities annotated to the candidate ut-\nterances are accurate and that the tailored questions\naccurately reflect the definitions of corresponding\nabilities. 4) Task difficulty : whether the distract-\ning utterances can be easily identified.\nUpon this, our quality control pipeline involves:\n•Inspector Training : All inspectors are required\nto complete a training session that includes pilot\ninspections of 2 world trees. We offer feedback\nto help them calibrate the inspection criteria.\n•Three-Stage Inspection : In the first stage, an an-\nnotator thoroughly reviews the world tree upon\nthe guidelines, identifying and correcting any\ncontent that fails to meet quality standards. In\nthe second stage, another annotator compares\nthe revised tree with the original, repeating the\ninspection process and discussing any discrepan-\ncies with the first annotator. If disagreements per-\nsist, the process moves to the third stage, where\na third annotator joins the discussion to resolve\ndifferences and decide on the final modifications.\n•Cross-Inspection and Full Check : Each world\ntree is initially reviewed by the first inspector and\nthen re-examined by a different inspector. Sim-\nilarly, the trees passing examinations by two in-\nspectors are finally reviewed by a third annotator.\nThe assignment of inspectors to the world trees\nis fully random, and the final average agreement\nrate on all world trees is 95%.\n3.3 Translation & Statistics of S OCIAL EVAL\nTranslation The world trees we collected were\ninitially crafted in Chinese. We used GPT-4o to\ntranslate them into English. To ensure the trans-\nlations remain faithful to the original content, we\nemploy professionals specializing in multi-lingual\ntranslation to review them. They are also required\nto evaluate the translated content with respect to the\ninspection guidelines. The average acceptance rate\nof the translations reaches 97%. The translation\nprompt is provided in Appendix B.\nStatistics The detailed statistics of SOCIAL EVAL\nis reported in Table 1. We crafted 153 world trees\ndistributed in 7 orientations of social worlds. The\nantisocial world, Induction and Conflict, each con-\ntains only 10 trees.

On average, each\nworld tree has 101 dialogue interactions between\ncharacters and contains 6.5 episodes, resulting in\n5.5 episode transitions. At each transition, there are\n2.17 candidate utterances, finally producing 9.46\nplot lines. These show the complex dynamics of\nour world trees. Based on these utterances, we\ncrafted 2,493 samples for interpersonal ability eval-\nuation, distributed across 5 aspects and 32 abilities\n(Figure 2). Note that a single candidate utterance\nmay reflect multiple abilities, thus the crafted ques-\ntions are also designed to assess these abilities.\n4 Experiments\nWe evaluate 19 LLMs: (1) Closed-source : GPT se-\nries (4, 4o, o1, OpenAI 2024), Claude-3 series (son-\nnet, opus, Anthropic 2024), GLM-4 (GLM et al.,\n2024). (2) Open-source : Llama-Instruct series\n(3.1-8B, 3.1-70B, 3.3-70B, Meta 2024), Qwen-2.5-\nInstruct series (7B, 14B, 32B, 72B, Qwen et al.\n2024), Mistral-Instruct series (7B-v0.3, 8*7B-v0.1,\n8*22B-v0.1, Jiang et al. 2023), GLM-4-9B-Chat,DeepSeek series (v3, r1, DeepSeek-AI et al. 2024,\n2025). More evaluated LLMs are in Appendix C.2.\nWe use Chain-of-Thought to prompt LLMs to\nperform outcome-oriented goal achievement eval-\nuation ( GAE ) and process-oriented interpersonal\nability evaluation ( IAE) tasks (Wei et al. 2022,\nprompts are in Appendix C.1). The metrics are\ngoal achievement ratio andability selection accu-\nracy. To avoid position bias, we randomly shuffle\nthe options’ order for each sample 3 times and de-\ntermine the LLM’s final choice by majority vote.\nWe establish human baselines by hiring 20 grad-\nuate students, native in Chinese and English, to\nrespectively complete tasks in two languages, each\nwith 14 samples for GAE and 160 samples for IAE.\nWe obtain Human (best) andHuman (average)\nbaselines by taking the best human result for each\ntask and averaging the results of all participants.\n4.1 Results and Findings\nWe report the results of LLMs and humans on two\ntasks of SI evaluation in Tables 2 and 3. Detailed\nresults on 32 specific abilities are in Appendix C.3.\nLLMs’ SI performance. First , open-source\nLLMs have slightly surpassed closed-source mod-\nels in both tasks, e.g., DeepSeek-R1 outperforms\no1 by 0.1%/0.6% ( GAE ) and Claude-3-opus by\n0.1%/0.2% ( IAE) at the Overall level ( zh/en ).Sec-\nond, open-source LLMs exhibit a positive correla-\ntion between performance and size in both tasks,\nshowing that LLMs’ SI strengthens as the parame-\nters grow. Third , machine SI still lags behind: all\nLLMs’ performance is distinctly lower than that of\nhumans’, with the smallest gap being 23.8%/17.2%\nand 3.2%/4.6% ( zh/en ,Human-average vs. best\nLLMs ) inGAE andIAE tasks at the Overall level.\nLLMs exhibit more distinct prosociality than\nhumans.

Here, we manually annotate\nthe behavioral polarity of each candidate utterance\ninSOCIAL EVAL, i.e., whether the expressed feel-\nings, thoughts, and actions are positive ,neutral ,\nornegative . We focus on world trees where LLMs\nfail, but humans succeed. To identify their behav-\nioral discrepancies, we retain only the trees with\na single successful ending, where LLMs and hu-\nmans make different selections at the same episode\ntransitions with varying behavioral polarities and\nendings. The behavioral distribution of 10 LLMs\nand humans are shown in Figure 3. Results show\nthat LLMs prefer positive behaviors to drive plot\nprogression, while models whose behavior distribu-\ntion aligns more closely with that of humans tend to\nperform better in GAE task, as supported by Table\n2. Moreover, in Figure 4, we visualize the distri-\nbution of different behavior combinations taken by\nLLMs and humans at the same episode transition\nSocial Engagement\nInnovation\nCooperation\nSelf-Management\nEmotional Resilience(a) Clusters of interpersonal abilities in Llama-3.1-8B.\nSelf-Management\nCooperation\nEmotional Resilience\nSocial Engagement\nInnovation\n(b) Clusters of interpersonal abilities in Llama-3.1-70B.\nFigure 5: Cluster distributions of interpersonal abilities\nin the representation space of Llama-3.1-8B & 70B.\n(more results are in Appendix C.4). Results further\nindicate that, compared to humans, LLMs are more\nlikely to select positive behaviors, even if they lead\nto goal failure. We also report the behavioral distri-\nbution of LLMs and humans from all world trees in\nGAE task, revealing similar findings (App. C.4).\nMultiple-choice questions-based SI evaluation\ncan effectively reflect LLMs’ generation capabil-\nity. We measure the difference between LLMs’\nbehaviors, i.e., selecting the options (our work) vs.\ndirect dialogue generation, in SI evaluation in the\nGAE task. Specifically, given the preceding plot at\nepisode transitions, we prompt the LLMs to gener-\nate protagonist’s next utterance (prompt is in Ap-\npendix C.6). Each LLM produces 100 samples in\nboth zhanden. We hire annotators to evaluate the\nsemantic similarity between the generated and can-\ndidate utterances, with each sample being labeled\nby three annotators. In Table 4, LLMs exhibit a\nhigh semantic similarity ratio, significantly increas-\ning with model size. This shows that our crafted\ncandidate utterances align closely with what the\nLLMs would generate in the given context. More-\nover, when semantically similar utterances exist in\nthe choice set, the average ratio of LLMs selecting\nsimilar candidate utterances exceeds 80%.\n--- Page 8 ---\nP er -neur on\nScor eCooper ation \nT op \nNeur onsCooper ation \nP er -neur on \nScor eEmotional \nR esilience \nT op \nNeur onsEmotional \nR esilience Isolat ed\nNeur onsCooper ation \nIsolat ed \nNeur onsEmotional \nR esilience Set\nDiff er ence\nLlama- 3 . 1-8BP er -neur on\nScor eCooper ation \nT op \nNeur onsCooper ation \nP er -neur on \nScor eEmotional \nR esilience \nT op \nNeur onsEmotional \nR esilience Isolat ed\nNeur onsCooper ation \nIsolat ed \nNeur onsEmotional \nR esilience Set\nDiff er ence\nLlama- 3 . 1- 7 0B8B VS 7 0B\n8B VS 7 0BFigure 6: Activated neurons of interpersonal abilities (Cooperation and Emotional Resilience) in Llama-3.1-8B\n& 70B. We identify the top neurons for each ability by computing per-neuron importance scores, then isolate\ncooperation-critical neurons from emotional resilience neurons using set differences, and vice versa.\n4.3 In-depth Analysis of LLMs’ SI at the\nRepresentation and Neuron Level\nNeurons clustered in human brains form specific\nfunctional groups (Sporns et al., 2005). By anal-\nogy, we analyze whether similar features of inter-\npersonal abilities can be found in LLMs. Here,\nwe employ Llama-3.1-8B & 70B as the backbone\nmodels, concatenating the question and the correct\ncandidate utterance for 5 aspects of interpersonal\nabilities in the IAE as the input for the LLMs. We\nexclude samples that involve composite abilities.\nLLMs’ interpersonal abilities exhibit a clustered\ndistribution in the representation space. We\ncluster and visualize the last input token’s hidden\nstate output by the LLM’s last layer using t-SNE.\nIn Figure 5, the 8B model partially distinguishes\nbetween 5 ability aspects, but there is still notable\noverlap between them. Yet, the 70B model more\nclearly separates these 5 aspects into distinct clus-\nters. This shows as LLMs’ size increases, interper-\nsonal abilities tend to evolve into specific groups.\nLLMs’ neurons activated by specific interper-\nsonal abilities form isolated regions. We use\nthe Wanda score (Sun et al., 2024) to identify acti-\nvated neurons (details are in Appendix D). We first\nseparately average all inputs’ neuron activation ma-\ntrices of each interpersonal ability. Following Deng\net al. (2024), we then average the per-neuron impor-\ntance scores in blocks of size 256 ×256 to reduce\nthe high-dimensional neuron matrices into a lower\ndimension. Finally, we retain the top weights to de-\nfine the neuron region for each interpersonal ability\nand isolate these regions using the set difference be-\ntween the neuron regions of two abilities (Wei et al.,\n2024). We show the isolated neuron regions for\nCooperation and Emotional Resilience in Figure 6.More results are in App. C.5. In the 8B model, each\ninterpersonal ability shows an isolated but sparse\nneuron region, while in the 70B model, these re-\ngions are more densely packed. This shows that\nas LLMs’ size increases, their SI evolves to form\nability-specific partitions at the neuron level, as\nreported by “lobes” hypothesis of Li et al. (2024b).\n5 Related Work\nAs LLMs’ capabilities grow (DeepSeek-AI et al.,\n2025), researchers start to explore whether LLMs\npossess human-like SI (Zhou et al., 2023a, 2025).\nA common method is to use LLMs for society sim-\nulations to model human behaviors (Park et al.,\n2023), which reveal LLMs’ social dynamics (Ataei\net al., 2024) and show parallels to human behaviors\n(Li et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2024), e.g., achieving\ngoals (Zhou et al., 2023b) and social norms evo-\nlution (Li et al., 2024a; Ren et al., 2024). This\nhas led to reports of emergent SI in LLMs (Takata\net al., 2024) and sparked interest in using LLMs\nto tackle interpersonal situations (Liu et al., 2023;\nLin et al., 2024) and test social science theories\n(Chuang et al., 2024), e.g., prosociality (Liu et al.,\n2024) and cooperation (Wu et al., 2024).\nTo evaluate LLMs’ SI, there are three types of\nbenchmarks. The first is inspired by clinical tests of\nSI for humans to assess theory-of-mind (Le et al.,\n2019; Shapira et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024), The\nsecond evaluates LLMs’ social understanding via\nsocial commonsense reasoning (Sap et al., 2019;\nZadeh et al., 2019). The third, closely related to\nour work (Zhou et al., 2023b; Wang et al., 2024;\nMou et al., 2024), asks LLMs to achieve predefined\ngoals in an interactive situation via role-playing\n(Zhou et al., 2024). Yet, they are often limited\nto single-episode social dynamics and lack a fine-\ngrained interactive process design for evaluating\n--- Page 9 ---\ngoal pursuit, thus hindering a holistic SI evaluation.\n6 Conclusions\nIn this paper, we propose SOCIAL EVAL, a script-\nbased bilingual SI benchmark, integrating outcome-\noriented goal achievement evaluation and process-\noriented interpersonal ability evaluation via man-\nually crafted narrative scripts. Each script forms\na world tree with a well-designed plot evolution,\nproviding a comprehensive view of how LLMs nav-\nigate social interactions. Experiments systemically\nanalyze the similarities and discrepancies between\nhumans’ and LLMs’ SI, from surface-level SI score\nto behavioral comparison during goal pursuit and\nto ability-specific functional partitions in LLMs,\noffering new insights for future work in LLMs’ SI.\nLimitations\nWe discuss the limitations of this work as follows.\nBenchmark Scale InSOCIAL EVAL, the average\nconstruction time for each world tree is approx-\nimately 12 hours, with an average cost of $40.\nThe entire process, from data construction to qual-\nity control, took about 4 months. The difficulty\nand cost of manual construction limit the scale\nofSOCIAL EVAL, which includes only 153 world\ntrees. Additionally, the antisocial worlds (i.e., In-\nduction, Conflict), which involve harming others’\ninterests, lack sufficient reference scripts from pub-\nlic sources, resulting in a smaller dataset for these\nworlds. Furthermore, each world tree is a coherent\nnarrative script. At each episode transition, the op-\ntions presented and the interpersonal abilities they\nexhibit are dynamically influenced by the preced-\ning plot. Therefore, while we manually crafted\n2,493 samples for interpersonal ability evaluation,\nthe distribution across 32 interpersonal abilities is\nnot balanced. There is an opportunity for future\nwork to expand the benchmark scale, enabling a\nmore detailed analysis of each social world and\ninterpersonal ability.\nBenchmark Language SOCIAL EVAL supports\nbilingual evaluation, with our English data derived\nfrom Chinese originals through translation. Al-\nthough we carefully designed prompts for transla-\ntion using GPT-4o and achieved a 97% acceptance\nrate through expert review, some cultural differ-\nences may still exist. Future efforts can build upon\nour construction methods to expand language cov-\nerage, better reflecting diverse cultural contexts.Ethical Considerations\nIn this work, we recruit a large number of human\nworkers for benchmark construction, quality con-\ntrol, and human experiments, who are primarily\ncollege students. These workers are compensated\nfairly based on the market price. Our collected\ndata do not contain any personal information. We\nare only responsible for publishing task informa-\ntion, and workers’ privacy can be well preserved.\nWe also declare that the antisocial worlds (i.e., In-\nduction and Conflict) were constructed solely for\nresearch purposes, and they may contain sensitive\nand unethical content. We will release our data\nfor research purposes. Our data is approved by the\nInstitutional Review Boards, and we believe our\nwork meets ACL’s Code of Ethics.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the National Key Re-\nsearch and Development Program of China (No.\n2024YFC3606800).

Their results on the GAE andIAE\ntask are shown in Tables 10 and 11, respectively.\nC.3 LLMs’ Performance on 32 Interpersonal\nAbilities\nDetailed results of all 32 interpersonal ability in the\nIAE tasks are shown in Tables 12, 13, 14, 15 and\n16, categorized into five tables according to the five\nability aspects.\nC.4 More Analysis for LLMs’ SI\nBehavior-level Analysis of LLMs’ SI Distribu-\ntions of different behavior combinations exhibited\nby more LLMs and humans at the same episode\ntransition are presented in Figure 7. We also statis-\ntic the behavioral distribution of LLMs and humans\nfrom all world trees in GAE task. As illustrated in\nFigure 8, the results further demonstrate that LLMs\nare more likely to select more positive behaviors.\n--- Page 14 ---\nMajor\nOrientationsOutcome Sub-\norientationsExplanations\nSelf-interest Altruism\nProsocial1 1 CooperationIndividuals prioritize both their own and others’ interests and tend to cooperate to achieve\nmutually beneficial outcomes.\n1 0 NegotiationIndividuals prioritize their own interests and tend to negotiate to secure their best possible\noutcomes.\n0 1 Assistance Individuals value the interests of others and tend to offer assistance.\n-1 1 Altruism Individuals sacrifice their own interests to support others, showing selflessness and altruism.\nProself 1 -1 CompetitionIndividuals prioritize their own interests, harm others’ interests of, and tend to achieve\ntheir goals through competition.\nAntisocial0 -1 Induction Individuals tend to influence others’ behavior in order to make them bear a loss of benefits.\n-1 -1 ConflictIndividuals disregard both their own and others’ interests, displaying antagonistic or destructive\nbehavior.\nTable 5: Social World Taxonomy. The social worlds are classified into 3 major categories and their corresponding 7\nsubcategories based on interpersonal orientations. The taxonomy does not include (self-interest, altruism) ∈\n[(0,0),(0,−1)], as the former lacks clear social goals and the latter is rare in the real world.\nAspects Abilities Definition\nSelf

Definitions of interpersonal ability inventory used in SOCIAL EVAL, which contains 5 aspects of interper-\nsonal abilities across 32 specific abilities.\nThe attention of LLMs and humans plays a key\nrole in shaping their social behaviors. To delve\ndeeper into what influences the social behaviors of\nLLMs and humans, we visualize their attention dis-\ntributions when deciding interpersonal abilities in\nIAE task. Treating generating an option as a social\nbehavior, we use samples where LLMs (i.e., Llama-\n3.1-8B) produce incorrect behavior to dissect the\ndifferences between LLMs and humans. Specifi-\ncally, when generating an option, we average the\nattention scores across the attention heads in 20\nlayers, identifying the top 30 keywords the LLM\nfocuses on when answering the question. We also\nask two annotators to provide the top 30 keywords\nthey attend to, and take the intersection of their key-words for visualization. The keywords attended to\nby LLMs and humans are shown in Figure 9. The\nresults show that LLMs focus more on options that\nare semantically aligned with the question, even if\nthey are incorrect. In contrast, humans focus more\non the parts of the incorrect option that violate the\nquestion, thus excluding the wrong answers. This\nhighlights the critical role of attention in shaping\nsocial behaviors and emphasizes the differences in\nSI between LLMs and humans.\nC.5 Neuronal Activation of More\nInterpersonal Abilities\nThe activated neurons of Cooperation and Inno-\nvation are shown in Figure 10.\nThe activated neurons of Cooperation and Self-\n--- Page 15 ---\nYou are an experienced translator who only uses English in translating all texts.\n[Task]\nTranslate the given Chinese social interactive game data to English.

That's understandable. Although I don't entirely agree with your \nmethods, I can understand your mindset at the time. You just wanted to draw attention and gain care and affection. But \nthat's enough; this is no excuse to turn bad.\nSimon: I can understand your actions because you want to gain attention and affection. But to be frank, it is impossible \nfor you.

Politically\nhumble and cautious, he never built his own faction and earned the new trust of Emperor Wu of Han.\nGoal: Hopes for world peace and no more wars.\nScenario\nAfter several generations of recuperation policies by early Han rulers, the national power of the Han\ndynasty was already quite strong when Emperor Liu Che of Han Wu came to the throne. Since his\nascension, Liu Che has reversed the initial defensive strategy of the Han, advancing actively, conquering\nvarious regions, and striving to achieve the ’great unity’ where the ’king rules all territories’. Liu Che’s\nprimary strategic goal was to ’eliminate the Hu’, meaning to remove the threat of the Xiongnu to the Han\ndynasty. To achieve this goal, he dispatched forces led by Wei Qing, Huo Qubing, and others to strike\nagainst the Xiongnu. Gaining the ruler’s favor, Wei Qing fights for the monarch, hoping to bring peace to\nthe people of the world.\nPlot\nElder Princess: Wei Qing, you’ve now been appointed to work at Jianzhang Palace, so you must be careful\nin all matters.

He was found in the bathtub at his home, with shards of broken liquor\nbottles scattered across the bathroom floor. The first to discover the body was Li Xiu Ying, a cleaner hired\nby Dini. By the time the police arrived that evening, there were no fingerprints left at the scene. The\nbathtub was filled with water, which contained a broken hairdryer still connected to the power socket. A\nforensic doctor conducted a preliminary examination, determining that Dini died from drowning, with no\nother injuries on his body. He was intoxicated at the time of his death, which is estimated to have occurred\nbetween 8 and 10 in the morning that day. The police initially concluded that the death was an accidental\ndrowning while bathing under the influence of alcohol. Dini’s wife, however, does not believe that her\nhusband’s death was accidental and has hired private detective Aqin to conduct a detailed investigation of\nthe incident.\nPlot\nFanny: What? My husband drowned in the bathtub? No, I don’t believe it. This has to be murder! If the\npolice can’t find the real culprit, then I’ll seek justice myself.\nAqin: (Answering the phone) Hello, this is private detective Aqin. Oh, Mrs. Fanny, hello.

My husband was a horror comic artist,\nwhich led to complaints from many parents that his comics might frighten children. I think this could be\na major reason for his murder. In addition, our house has three keys, besides my husband and me, the\ncleaning lady, Li Xiuying, also has a key. I’m begging you, Miss Aqin, please find out the truth.\nAqin: Rest assured, Mrs. Fanny, uncovering the truth is every detective’s duty.

Besides the missing bottle cap, there’s\na dent on the upper frame of the bathroom door. There’s not much water in the bathtub, but enough to\nsubmerge a person. There’s no excess water outside the tub. Looks like further investigation is necessary.\nOfficer Li: Hello, Miss A-qin. I’m Officer Li, responsible for investigating this case. If you think Danini\ndidn’t die by suicide, what’s your next investigation plan?\nQuestion for Detail Management\nHow should A-qin carefully observe Danini’s death scene to uncover details and prove her meticulous\ndetective work?\nChoices\nA. Danini’s death seems very peaceful, without signs of struggle. My initial judgment is that it could be a\nnatural death. I will further investigate to confirm this hypothesis.\nB. Although Danini was lying calmly in the bathtub with no apparent struggle, the buttonhole on his\nshirt cuff was stretched wide, and he didn’t die of electrocution by the hairdryer. This is definitely not an\naccident.\nC. It seems like Danini’s death could be a simple accident, but I can’t shake the feeling there’s an unknown\nsecret behind it, perhaps triggered by something he did while alive, setting off unforeseen chain reactions.\nD.

His daily life is quite uneventful; he attends classes on time and, during breaks, he is only\ninterested in playing games with his roommates in their dorm. His life is fairly relaxed. Wu Xie’s dorm\naccommodates four people; compared to his three roommates, he is quite ordinary—not too tall, not too\nshort, not too fat, not too thin—totally inconspicuous, but he doesn’t care about such things.\nGoal: Survive the zombie virus outbreak at school without getting infected.\nScenario\nThe university campus, after an unusual heavy rain, suddenly experiences a zombie virus outbreak. Many\npeople on campus are unfortunately infected, throwing the entire campus into chaos and panic. The\nprotagonist, Wu Xie, an ordinary junior student, unexpectedly becomes one of the survivors of this disaster.\nConfronted with the sudden threat of zombies, he relies on his intelligence and courage to survive in this\ndangerous environment.\nPlot\nOld Wang: (Returning to the dormitory after another afternoon’s class) Class is over, awesome! Everyone,\ncome play some games!\nWu Xie: Alright, the season is here, I need to rank up quickly!\nOld Li: (After playing for a while) Hey guys, there’s a girl waiting for me outside. I’m going out to have\nsome fun, why don’t you all come along? There are tons of girls.\nOld Zhang: (With a sigh) Really envious, but I still love gaming.

You’re the one who has all the girls interested, not us. They’re asking for you, not\nfor us.\nB. Old Li invited us, which definitely means he wants us to join. If no one wants to go with him, he’d be\nreally upset, so I’ll go along.\nC. Hey guys, can we really have a good time if we go out now?

Li Xiang was bitten by accident but did not turn into a zombie.\nInstead, he retained his human consciousness and gradually discovered that he had the ability to control\nzombies...\nPlot\nzombie: Ugh (wandering in groups across the square.)\nLi Xiang: All zombies, come stand before me within three minutes!\nzombie: Okay! (Gathering in the square as per Li Xiang’s command.)\nXiaodu: As far as I know, you can now control zombies! What do you plan to do? Help humans eradicate\nzombies? Or have a bit of fun first?\nQuestion for Ethical Competence\nWhat would an ethically responsible Li Xiang do?\nChoices\nA. Helping humans eradicate zombies is meaningful, but if I want to survive and thrive in this new world,\nI may need to first secure my own position. Once I am stronger, I can then consider how to help them.\nThat would also be more efficient, right? This is a critical moment. If bad people discover my ability, it\nwould surely be disadvantageous to me and to humanity—better to keep it hidden for now and observe the\nsituation.\nB. I never imagined having this kind of power, but if I can use it to end this catastrophe, I must. Even if\nhumanity has abandoned me, I cannot let the world fall into endless destruction. Humanity now faces a\nmajor disaster, and I should stand up and lend a hand! Zombies, hear my command: go to the top of the\ntallest buildings and jump off!\nC. I never imagined having this power, but if I can use it to end this disaster, I must. Humanity is facing\nunprecedented challenges, and I should think of a solution. Perhaps I shouldn’t rush to a decision. The\nzombies under my control are already sufficient, and they temporarily pose no greater threat to humans. If\nI wait a bit longer, there might be a better chance to decide how to act and avoid making hasty mistakes\nnow.\nD. Eradicating zombies is undoubtedly a good thing, but the power I now possess might be a chance\nto change the world. If I can find a way to use the power of zombies to make the world a better place,\nperhaps humans and zombies can coexist. I won’t be quick to eliminate them yet; I’ll first see if there’s a\nmore balanced solution. Let me think about how I can use my superpower for a bit of fun!\nTable 39: Data example for Ethical Competence.

However, after two months of\ninvestigation, the police have yet to uncover any leads from their only suspect, Zhen Huaxin. As Zhen\nHuaxin seems poised to escape the law’s punishment, Xiao Bai hires a private detective named Poirot and\nuses her years of reading detective novels and watching mystery movies to bring Zhen Huaxin to justice.\nPlot\nLi Xiang: (Li Xiang notified Xiaobai to come to the police station to tell him the investigation results.)\nXiaobai, our police investigation has made it clear that Zhen Huaxin had nothing to do with your sister’s\ndeath.\nXiaobai: How is that possible? My sister and the other two victims all went to that bar the day before\nthey died. Zhen Huaxin frequents this bar and flirts with countless women. My sister and the others were\namong them. How could it be such a coincidence?\nLi Xiang: (Looking at Xiaobai a bit angrily) This is the result of our police investigation. Zhen Huaxin\nhas been cleared of suspicion.

(agilely dodges the slap) Officer, I am also a Hutu. I understand this sense of ethnic identity, but Tutsis\nare humans too, not so-called Tutsi cockroaches!\nB. Though Hutus and Tutsis are different peoples, they live together on this land, and we are brothers to\none another. We should live in harmony. If you agree, I would like to offer you a gift.\nC. The Hutus are fierce and brave, indeed should be stronger than the Tutsis. I’ll let you search the hotel.\nIf you find any Tutsis, I’ll hand them over to you.\nD. Officer, although I admittedly sheltered some Tutsis, I assure you, I only took in the weak, those unable\nto fight back. They pose no threat to the Hutus.\nTable 48: Data example for Cultural Competence.

He believes his family is very poor and is often\nbullied by classmates in class. After returning home, he needs to take care of his paraplegic grandmother.\nHe has a strong sense of morality and self-respect.\nGoal: To be a competent son and not disappoint his parents.\nScenario\nLiu Jiye is currently in elementary school. On this day, during recess, he’s discussing electronic products\nwith his classmates. His parents often prevent him from playing on the computer due to concerns about\nhis studies.\nPlot\nWang Shui: (Pulls out the iPad his dad bought him from his backpack) Hey everyone, look at this. This is\nthe latest model iPad my dad bought me. Jealous?\nLiu Jiye: (Looks at the iPad eagerly) Wang Shui, can you lend me the iPad to play for a few days? I’ll\nreturn it to you next Monday.\nWang Shui: Lend it to you? Dream on. With your family’s financial condition, you’ll never afford this in\na lifetime. Besides, if you damage it, how could you afford to compensate?\nLiu Jiye: I won’t just borrow your iPad for free. How about I give you one yuan every week?\n/* ...... */ (omitted multi-turn dialogue)\nLiu Jiye: There was a little issue at school, but don’t worry about that now. I just saw Grandma playing\nbasketball, which is impossible, right? Wasn’t she paralyzed since I was in elementary school? How can\nshe play basketball?\nGrandmother: (Quickly tidying up and pretending to lie in bed) Who’s back? Is it Jiye? Grandma hasn’t\ngone anywhere; I’ve been lying at home all afternoon. Did you see wrong?\nQuestion for Information Processing Skill\nHow should Liu Jiye appropriately express himself to indicate his ability to swiftly and logically analyze\nclues when faced with Dad’s and Grandma’s rebuttals?\nChoices\nA. Really, Grandma, did I see wrong? Did you really stay in bed all afternoon? I was criticized by the\nteacher today, so maybe I was in a bad mood and my eyes were blurry, mistaking someone else for you!\nB. Really? There could be two possibilities: first, the person playing basketball wasn’t Grandma but\nsomeone who looks a lot like her; second, that person was indeed Grandma, who, for some reason, can\nstand up again but hasn’t told me.\nC. Really? No way, I’m sure I didn’t see wrong, Grandma, you were clearly playing basketball on the\ncourt earlier. And Dad, don’t try to fool me, Grandma’s paralysis is clearly cured. Even though I got\ncriticized by the teacher today, seeing Grandma able to play basketball again makes me truly happy and\nglad that she’s healthy and by my side!\nD. Really, Dad, I think you and Grandma have been acting. Are you rehearsing some show? I really just\nsaw Grandma playing basketball on the court, with no signs of paralysis. Are you acting something out?\nIs it to give me a surprise? I’m really happy if Grandma’s paralysis is cured. If it’s true, that would be\nwonderful!\nTable 49: Data example for Information Processing Skill. The red text indicates the correct answer.",
