  "title": "Agent-X: Evaluating Deep Multimodal Reasoning in Vision-Centric Agentic\n  Tasks",
  "summary": "Deep reasoning is fundamental for solving complex tasks, especially in\nvision-centric scenarios that demand sequential, multimodal understanding.\nHowever, existing benchmarks typically evaluate agents with fully synthetic,\nsingle-turn queries, limited visual modalities, and lack a framework to assess\nreasoning quality over multiple steps as required in real-world settings. To\naddress this, we introduce Agent-X, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating\nvision-centric agents multi-step and deep reasoning capabilities in real-world,\nmultimodal settings. Agent- X features 828 agentic tasks with authentic visual\ncontexts, including images, multi-image comparisons, videos, and instructional\ntext. These tasks span six major agentic environments: general visual\nreasoning, web browsing, security and surveillance, autonomous driving, sports,\nand math reasoning. Our benchmark requires agents to integrate tool use with\nexplicit, stepwise decision-making in these diverse settings. In addition, we\npropose a fine-grained, step-level evaluation framework that assesses the\ncorrectness and logical coherence of each reasoning step and the effectiveness\nof tool usage throughout the task. Our results reveal that even the\nbest-performing models, including GPT, Gemini, and Qwen families, struggle to\nsolve multi-step vision tasks, achieving less than 50% full-chain success.\nThese findings highlight key bottlenecks in current LMM reasoning and tool-use\ncapabilities and identify future research directions in vision-centric agentic\nreasoning models.
