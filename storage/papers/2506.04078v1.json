The data is derived from publicly available datasets\nand real-world clinical records. Medical professionals create reference answers, prompts, and evaluation checklists\nthrough multiple refinement rounds to ensure high-quality assessment criteria and human-machine agreement.\n(AIIMS, 2025), USMLE (United States) (USMLE,\n2025), CNMLE (China) (CNMLE, 2025), MedQA\n(Singhal et al., 2023) and MedMCQA (Pal et al.,\n2022), which use licensing-exam questions to as-\nsess a model’s medical knowledge but are con-\nstrained by their reliance on multiple-choice for-\nmats and cannot capture open-ended reasoning.\nFurthermore, benchmarks of specialized tasks,\nsuch as PubMedQA (Jin et al., 2019) for document\ncomprehension, MedNLI (Herlihy and Rudinger,\n2021) for clinical reasoning, and MedCalc-Bench\n(Khandekar et al., 2024) for medical calculation,\nwhich provide deeper insights into specific subdo-\nmains yet remain narrowly scoped, often lack real-\nworld variability, and depend on token-level met-\nrics that fail to reflect clinical correctness. Finally,\ncomprehensive application benchmarks, such as\nMedBench (Cai et al., 2023), MultiMedQA (Sing-\nhal et al., 2022) and MedJourney (Wu et al., 2024),\nwhich integrate diverse tasks and data sources to\nsimulate real-world clinical settings but still lean\non constrained question types and unreliable evalu-\nation metrics like ROUGE (Lin, 2004) and BLEU\n(Papineni et al., 2002), thus falling short of mirror-\ning the full complexity of clinical practice.\nTo address the limitations of existing medical\nbenchmarks, we introduce LLMEval-Med icine, a\ncomprehensive benchmark designed to more au-\nthentically and systematically evaluate LLMs in\nmedical contexts. LLMEval-Med features 2,996\nhigh-quality questions, all derived from real-world\nclinical scenarios and electronic health records,rather than public internet sources. The dataset cov-\ners five core medical dimensions—medical knowl-\nedge, language understanding, reasoning, text gen-\neration, and safety ethics—and is further subdi-\nvided into 27 secondary capability indicators. This\nmulti-level structure ensures a granular and clin-\nically relevant assessment, with a strong empha-\nsis on open-ended generation tasks and complex\nreasoning, moving beyond the limitations of tradi-\ntional multiple-choice formats. All questions and\nreference answers are rigorously reviewed by medi-\ncal professionals to guarantee both authenticity and\nclinical validity. The differences between existing\nbenchmarks and LLMEval-Med are summarized\nin Table 1.\nIn addition to its comprehensive dataset,\nLLMEval-Med introduces a robust and dynamic\nevaluation methodology. We combine automated\nscoring—leveraging state-of-the-art LLMs (such as\nGPT-4o) as judges—with expert-developed check-\nlists and human review. This LLM-as-Judge\nframework is continuously refined through human-\nmachine agreement analysis, ensuring that auto-\nmated scores align closely with expert standards.\nThe evaluation pipeline not only assesses factual\ncorrectness and reasoning, but also incorporates\nsafety and ethical considerations, providing a holis-\ntic view of model performance. By integrating\nexpert feedback and iterative checklist optimiza-\ntion, LLMEval-Med delivers a reliable and practi-\ncal framework for benchmarking medical LLMs in\nreal-world scenarios.\n--- Page 3 ---\nOpen QA \n(2495, 83.28%)Closed QA \n(501, 16.72%)\nMK \n(491, 16.39%)\nMR \n(363, 12.12%)\nMLU \n(877, 29.27%)MTG \n(500, 16.69%)MSE \n(765, 25.53%)\nCategoryAverage \nToken\nLength\nMK \nMR \nMLU \nMSE \nMTG21.05\n241.45\n525.82\n55.28\n1485.98Figure 2: The left chart shows the distribution of question types, with Open QA dominating; the middle chart\npresents the distribution of the five evaluation categories, showing both sample counts and proportions; the right\ntable lists the average tokens per category.\nIn summary, our contributions can be outlined\nin three key aspects:\n1.We construct a comprehensive dataset of\nnearly 3,000 questions derived from real-\nworld clinical data rather than public internet\nsources, covering five essential medical di-\nmensions with emphasis on open-ended tasks.\n2.We design a dynamic evaluation framework\nthat combines automated LLM-as-Judge as-\nsessment with expert-developed checklists,\ncontinuously refined through human-machine\nagreement analysis to ensure reliability.\n3.We conduct extensive experiments across mul-\ntiple types of LLMs (specialized medical mod-\nels, open-source models, and closed-source\nmodels), revealing important insights about\ntheir relative strengths and limitations in med-\nical contexts.\n2 Related Work\nIn recent years, large-scale question-answering\nbenchmarks have formed the backbone of medi-\ncal LLM evaluation. MedMCQA (Pal et al., 2022)\nand MedQA (Singhal et al., 2023) draw on thou-\nsands of Indian postgraduate and USMLE (2025)\nexam items to test factual recall and domain rea-\nsoning, while MultiMedQA (Singhal et al., 2022)\nunifies diverse sources—from PubMed (Jin et al.,\n2019) abstracts to consumer health queries—to\nchallenge models across both specialist and layper-\nson prompts.\nBeyond simple recall, specialized tests probe in-\nferential and quantitative skills. MedNLI (Herlihy\nand Rudinger, 2021) reframes clinical note pairs as\nentailment tasks to assess models’ ability to infer\ndiagnoses and contradictions, and MedCalc-Bench\n(Khandekar et al., 2024)offers patient-scenario cal-culations, demanding both correct numerical output\nand clear stepwise justification.\nTo mirror real-world practice and multimodal\ndemands, benchmarks like MedJourney (Wu et al.,\n2024) trace the full care pathway—from initial\nplanning through follow-up—while WorldMedQA-\nV (Matos et al., 2024) pairs multilingual exam ques-\ntions with medical images, testing cross-lingual\nand vision-language capabilities in four languages.\nFor Mandarin-language evaluation, WebMedQA\n(He et al., 2019) supplies over 60 000 real pa-\ntient questions with verified answers; CMedQA\n(Zhang et al., 2017) and its successor CMedQA2\n(Zhang et al., 2018) build on community forums\nwith 50 000–100 000 clinician–patient exchanges;\nand CBLUE (Zhang et al., 2022) spans eight NLU\ntasks—entity recognition, relation extraction, diag-\nnosis normalization, and more—to reveal persistent\ngaps. On top of these, MedBench (Cai et al., 2023)\nand MedGPTEval (Xu et al., 2023) offer automated,\ncloud-based pipelines and blinded expert review to\nensure Chinese medical LLMs are assessed across\nthe full spectrum of clinical reasoning, communi-\ncation, and computational robustness.\n3 LLMEval-Med\nLLMEval-Medicine aims to provide a systematic\nand comprehensive evaluation of medical founda-\ntion models. We first detail the dataset, including\nits construction methodology and data taxonomy in\nSection 3.1. We then outline the evaluation frame-\nwork and the metrics employed in Sections 3.2\nand 3.2.\n3.1 Dataset\nAs part of the LLMEval-Med framework, we have\ndeveloped a large-scale benchmark dataset contain-\ning 2,996 high-quality test questions. Figure 1 il-\nlustrates an instance in our dataset. Each data entry\nincludes a question, a reference answer authored\n--- Page 4 ---\nand refined by medical experts, a prompt simulat-\ning real-world usage, and a checklist specifying\nkey content requirements. Additional metadata\nsuch as category and subcategory helps organize\nquestions by medical domain for fine-grained eval-\nuation. For detailed source references, please refer\nto Appendix B.\nCategories When constructing a benchmark\ndataset tailored for large language models (LLMs)\nin medical scenarios, our classification approach\narises primarily from two perspectives: (1) the hi-\nerarchical capabilities of LLMs, and (2) the pro-\nfessional requirements inherent to medical practice\nand research.\nTypically, LLMs progress from mastering foun-\ndational knowledge toward deeper language under-\nstanding, complex reasoning, and ultimately so-\nphisticated text generation. Translated into medi-\ncal contexts, this progression corresponds to mov-\ning from grasping basic medical concepts and ter-\nminologies, through semantic comprehension and\nclinical decision-making inference, to generating\ncompliant and accurate medical content.\nConsequently, we categorize our dataset into five\ncore capabilities: Medical Knowledge (MK) for\nbasic concepts, Medical Language Understand-\ning (MLU) for text comprehension and extraction,\nMedical Reasoning (MR) for clinical inference,\nMedical Text Generation (MTG) for coherent\nmedical writing, and Medical Safety and Ethics\n(MSE) for ethical and safety compliance.\nFigure 2 illustrates the distribution of questions\nacross these categories. MK and MSE categories\ntypically involve shorter, straightforward questions\nfocusing on fundamental medical facts or ethical\nconsiderations without extensive reasoning. In con-\ntrast, MLU and MR categories typically encompass\nintricate reasoning tasks or comprehensive clinical\ntext comprehension, frequently including case anal-\nyses or information extraction. Meanwhile, MTG\nincludes the most demanding tasks, involving ex-\ntended medical text generation and open-ended re-\nsponses. Overall, task complexity escalates from\nfoundational knowledge through analytical reason-\ning to extended text generation, allowing for a thor-\nough evaluation of medical large language models\nacross multiple dimensions.\nRegarding detailed medical classification, we\nfurther established secondary-level subcategories\nunder these five major categories. These secondary\ncategories were developed according to medical\npractice principles, clinical workflows, and practi-cal needs of various medical departments and dis-\nease areas. This detailed sub-categorization not\nonly integrates multi-level capability indicators and\nevaluation dimensions highlighted by existing med-\nical benchmarks but also incorporates professional\nrecommendations from physician teams, ensuring\nclinical relevance and practical applicability.\nThe detailed criteria for our classification are\nprovided in Appendix F.\nSubcategories LLMEval-Med defines five ma-\njor categories, each encompassing a set of med-\nically significant capabilities and associated sub-\ncategories. These categories include: (1) Medical\nKnowledge (MK) that evaluates a model’s abil-\nity to acquire core theoretical and practical med-\nical knowledge across disciplines. Based on the\nnational standard (Li Xiaolin et al., 2009), it in-\ncludes subcategories such as Basic Medicine ,Clin-\nical Medicine , and Public Health and Preventive\nMedicine . This category assesses factual recall,\nconceptual clarity, and foundational understand-\ning required for downstream reasoning tasks; (2)\nMedical Language Understanding (MLU) that\ntests whether models can accurately interpret and\nmanipulate various medical text forms. It includes\nInformation Extraction ,Text Classification ,Trans-\nlation Matching ,Tabular Data Processing ,Multi-\nturn Dialogue , and Summarization , focusing on\nsemantic comprehension, information structuring,\nand multilingual alignment in clinical scenarios;\n(3) Medical Reasoning (MR) that assesses the\nmodel’s ability to perform clinical inference and\ndecision-making by integrating domain knowledge\nand contextual understanding. It comprises sub-\ncategories like Scientific Research ,Symptom Infer-\nence,Treatment Plans , and Efficacy Evaluation ,\nsimulating real-world diagnostic and therapeutic\nreasoning; (4) Medical Text Generation (MTG)\nthat evaluates the model’s capacity to generate ac-\ncurate, fluent, and context-aware medical content.\nSubcategories include Summarization ,Rewriting ,\nandGeneration , covering a range of tasks from\nsimplifying technical text to producing patient ed-\nucation materials and clinical documentation; (5)\nMedical Safety and Ethics (MSE) that ensures\nthe model adheres to ethical principles and patient\nsafety protocols. It includes Medical Ethics ,Drug\nSafety ,Prohibited Medical Practices , and Safety of\nIntervention , aiming to prevent harmful recommen-\ndations and reinforce trustworthy AI behavior in\nhealthcare contexts.\n--- Page 5 ---\nLLMs tested such as \nDeepseek, Llama and ChatGPT\nResponseYou are a highly professional and comprehensive doctor, \npossessing all the essential knowledge and skills required of a \nmedical professional.\nYou must carefully review each question,check whether the \nresponses assess the responses based on four criteria: \ninstruction adherence, accuracy, effectiveness, and \nreadability.\nYou should compare the students' answers with the reference \nanswer and strictly follow the grading criteria.\nThe key information related to the core requirements must be \nconsistent with the reference answer.\nThe response must not contain any critical errors and must \nfully meet both the core and secondary requirements.\nThe response must comply with medical standards and pose \nno medical safety risks.Prompt\nCombined Scoring\nGPT-4o scoring Manual scoringQuestion\nMedical Knowledge\nWhy is β -OH anthraquinone more acidic than α -OH \nanthraquinone…\nLanguage Understanding\nComparing women‘s adherence to follow -up \nrecommendations for colposcopy or …\nMedical Reasoning\nPlease help me extract specific drug entities from the \ngiven text and indicate their respective categories…\nMedical Safety and Ethics\nI had an examination at a hospital, but I found that \nmy medical records were leaked to a third party…\nMedical Text Generation\nI can't find the medical record of a child who vomited. \nPlease find it from the following content and write \nthe patient's medical record information in the \nrequired format…\nScore\nChecklistCore•Explain the reason why…\n•Provide a detailed explanation of …\nMinor•Emphasize the interaction between…ResponseResponse\nScoreScore①\n②\n③Figure 3: Evaluation flowchart of LLMEval-Med.The evaluation questions span five task categories: Medical\nKnowledge, Language Understanding, Medical Reasoning, Medical Safety and Ethics, and Medical Text Generation.\nFor each question, the large model generates three independent responses; GPT-4o scores each response based\non the provided prompt and checklist, and these scores are combined with human ratings to produce three sets of\nscores, the average of which reflects the model’s overall capability.\n3.2 Evaluation\nIn this section, we describe the evaluation method-\nology of LLMEval-Med, as illustrated in Fig-\nure 3. To ensure objectivity and consistency, we\nadopt an automated scoring system supported by\nhuman evaluation on selected samples for cross-\nverification and deeper analysis.\nAutomated Evaluation We adopt the “LLM-\nas-Judge” approach (Zheng et al., 2023), using\na sota LLM as the evaluator for automated scor-\ning. The evaluation includes four core components:\nPrompt (defining the role and task background),\nQuestion, Response, and Reference Answer. Dur-\ning scoring, the judge model utilizes structured\nscoring prompts to ensure consistent evaluation\ncriteria. These prompts explicitly define scoring\ndimensions, metrics, and rules, thereby reducing\nsubjective variability. Detailed prompt designs are\nprovided in Appendix C, and specific scoring ex-\namples are available in Appendix G.\nPrior to the formal evaluation, we conducted a\npreliminary experiment comparing the automated\nscoring performance of representative LLMs, in-\ncluding GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2023) and Claude 3.5\n(Anthropic, 2025). The results demonstrated that\nGPT-4o achieved higher average scores across\nvarious medical tasks and exhibited substantially\nlower variability in repeated scorings (the variabil-ity when scoring the same response five times was\nonly 0.99%). Consequently, GPT-4o was selected\nas the core model for automated evaluation, offer-\ning enhanced stability and credibility in scoring\noutcomes. Furthermore, each test sample was sub-\njected to three rounds of randomized scoring to\nobtain more reliable and robust evaluation results.\nWhen evaluating models on MK, MLU, and\nMTG tasks, we developed a human-annotated Scor-\ning Checklist, composed of Core Requirements and\nSecondary Requirements. The Core Requirements\nhighlight the essential information expected in a\ncorrect response, while the Scoring Guidelines pro-\nvide detailed criteria for each scoring level. No-\ntably, the checklist underwent multiple rounds of re-\nfinement to enhance alignment between human and\nautomated evaluations. This iterative optimization\nsignificantly improves scoring accuracy, mitigates\nerrors arising from model limitations, and ensures\ngreater objectivity and reliability in the evaluation\noutcomes.\nHuman Evaluation In all question categories,\nwe employ manual scoring to assess the us-\nability of model responses. Since text gener-\nation standards inherently involve a degree of\nsubjectivity—particularly when evaluating MTG\ntasks—responses are systematically rated across\nfive core dimensions: Safety, Instruction Following,\n--- Page 6 ---\nModel OP MK MLU MR MSE MTG\nOpen-source LLMs\nDeepseek-R1 64.23 84.16 69.64 63.40 59.63 44.33\nQwen-72B 51.53 55.56 47.42 50.83 60.55 43.30\nQwen-32B 48.87 52.25 46.48 42.24 61.11 42.27\nDeepseek-V3 48.03 51.06 53.68 38.24 47.71 49.48\nMistral-24B 46.42 45.15 43.35 28.10 50.15 22.68\nllama-3.1-8B 26.65 16.78 20.50 18.63 25.38 29.90\nClosed-source LLMs\no1-preview 61.23 65.25 63.85 62.75 64.81 49.48\nGPT-4o 58.73 61.23 56.34 55.23 56.27 64.58\no1-mini 57.86 56.03 60.09 60.40 63.30 49.48\nSpecialized LLMs\nBaichuan-M1 60.34 70.69 63.22 62.09 50.76 54.95\nBaichuan-M1-14B 55.43 62.88 40.53 55.23 70.03 48.45\nHuatuoGPT-o1-72B 52.27 53.43 49.45 56.86 56.27 45.36\nDISC-MedLLM 11.34 7.09 10.02 7.52 23.24 2.06\nTable 2: Comparison of LLM performance across medical domains.

This threshold-based strategy offers\na more accurate reflection of practical utility com-\npared to simply averaging scores.\nSpecifically for MTG tasks, we implement a\nmanual scoring mapping mechanism. Each re-\nsponse is evaluated across five dimensions: Instruc-\n--- Page 7 ---\ntion Following ,Correctness ,Effectiveness ,Read-\nability , and Safety , which are individually scored\nand subsequently mapped to a unified 0–7 scale (de-\ntails provided in Appendix D). Responses achiev-\ning a score of 5 or higher on this scale are deemed\nusable, ensuring consistency between manual eval-\nuations and the automated evaluation framework.\nUnder the current methodology, the human-\nmachine agreement rate for automated evaluation\nof overall tasks reaches 92.36%. A detailed analy-\nsis is available in Section 4.2. This metric quanti-\nfies the extent to which automated evaluations and\nhuman assessments consistently classify responses\nas usable, with higher values indicating greater re-\nliability. To further enhance this agreement, we\nrefined the evaluation checklist by systematically\nanalyzing cases with low consistency and adjusting\nor introducing relevant criteria to minimize subjec-\ntive bias. Additionally, we optimized the prompt\ndesign for GPT-4o based on extensive feedback\nfrom automated evaluations, ensuring closer align-\nment with human judgment standards.\n4 Evaluating LLMs on LLMEval-Med\n4.1 Experiment Setting\nIn order to evaluate the performance of various\nlanguage models, we randomly selected 677 ques-\ntions from the complete dataset to form a test set,\nand evaluated three types of models: (1) Open-\nsource models including DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-\nAI et al., 2025), DeepSeek-V3 (DeepSeek-AI et al.,\n2024), Qwen2.5-72B/32B (Yang et al., 2024),\nMistral-24B (Team), and Llama-3.1-8B (Dubey\net al., 2024); (2) Closed-source models includ-\ning o1-preview (OpenAI, 2024a), o1-mini (Ope-\nnAI, 2024b), and GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2023); and (3)\nSpecialized medical models including Baichuan-\nM1/M1-14B (Wang et al., 2025), HuatuoGPT-o1-\n72B (Chen et al., 2024), and DISC-MedLLM (Bao\net al., 2023). Although our dataset primarily con-\ntains Chinese medical questions, we included mod-\nels trained predominantly on English data to inves-\ntigate cross-lingual performance. All models were\nevaluated with their default configurations during\nthe experiments.\n4.2 Experimental Results\nOverall Performance\nThis subsection evaluates the overall usability of\nLLMs across all tasks in LLMEval-Med.

Detailed scores\nfor each subcategory can be found in Appendix E.\nWe also conduct detail case studies in Appendix G,\nand analyze four common error types.\nOverall, the usability of LLMs in medical con-\ntexts remains moderate, with overall performance\n(OP) scores consistently below 70% across all eval-\nuated models. Even the best-performing models,\nsuch as DeepSeek-R1 (64.23%) and o1-preview\n(61.23%), reveal considerable room for improve-\nment in enhancing LLMs’ comprehensive medical\ncapabilities. These findings highlight the current\nlimitations of LLMs for clinical deployment.\nTask-specific analyses reveal a consistent per-\nformance hierarchy across different medical tasks.\nMedical Knowledge consistently achieves the high-\nest scores across models, markedly outperform-\ning other dimensions.

These trends are illustrated in Figure 4.\nLastly, performance in Medical Safety and\nEthics (MSE) shows greater variability across mod-\nels. For instance, Baichuan-M1-14B achieves a\nrelatively high MSE score of 70.03%, demonstrat-\ning strong alignment with safety and ethical stan-\ndards. In contrast, models like DeepSeek-R1, de-\nspite strong performance in other areas, scored\nlower in MSE (59.63%). This variation suggests\nthat high overall usability does not guarantee robust\nadherence to medical safety and ethical guidelines,\nunderscoring the importance of explicitly incor-\nporating safety and ethics considerations during\nmodel development and evaluation.\nMedical Text Generation Results Given the\nopen-ended nature of the Medical Text Generation\ntask, we designed a dedicated human evaluation\nframework comprising five dimensions: Instruction\nFollowing ,Correctness ,Effectiveness ,Readability ,\nandSafety . This subsection provides an in-depth\nanalysis of LLM performance on MTG.\nTable 3 presents the detailed human evaluation\nresults for MTG across the five dimensions. To\ncompute an overall usability score, we apply a com-\nposite mapping function based on these individual\nscores, as described in Appendix D. A response is\nconsidered usable only if it achieves a score of 4 or\n5 in all five dimensions, reflecting a strict standard\naligned with high-stakes medical requirements.\nIn MTG tasks, models generally demonstrate\nstrong overall performance, but notable differences\nare observed across dimensions. Most models\nachieve their highest scores in Effectiveness and\nReadability, typically exceeding 4.5, indicating\nstrong capabilities in generating high-quality med-\nical content. In contrast, scores for InstructionFollowing and Correctness are slightly lower, con-\ncentrated in the 4.0 to 4.4 range, suggesting that\ncurrent models still face challenges in consistently\nfollowing complex instructions and ensuring fac-\ntual medical accuracy.\nRegarding Safety, most models achieve an aver-\nage score close to a perfect 0.99. However, we\nadopt a strict veto policy for safety evaluation:\nsafety scores are binarized to either 0 or 1. If a\nresponse receives a safety score of 0, it is imme-\ndiately classified as unusable, regardless of perfor-\nmance in other dimensions.\nHuman-Machine Agreement We also inves-\ntigate the consistency between human evaluation\nand automated scoring, especially for open-ended\ntasks. Figure 5 shows the human-machine agree-\nment rates for usability judgments across five eval-\nuation categories. Categories MK, MR, MLU, and\nMSE maintain high consistency, reaching an over-\nall agreement rate of 92.47%. In contrast, the agree-\nment rate for MTG is significantly lower, leading\nus to adopt human evaluation results for reporting\nusability rates in the main experimental table.\nTo further understand this gap, we randomly\nselected three models for analysis. As shown in\nFigure 6, inconsistencies primarily arise when au-\ntomated methods classify samples as usable, but\nhuman evaluators judge them as unusable.\nThis highlights the critical importance of human\nevaluation for open-ended tasks. In the medical\ndomain, text generation must meet exceptionally\nhigh standards. Consistency checks between hu-\nman and automated evaluations are also essential.\nThey reveal evaluation gaps and ensure alignment\nwith the rigorous demands of medical applications.\n--- Page 9 ---\n5 Conclusion\nWe present LLMEval-Med, a benchmark focused\non generative medical tasks across five core\ndimensions. We open-source the dataset and\nexpert-designed checklists, achieving high human-\nmachine agreement for most evaluation tasks. Our\nresults show that while LLMs perform well in\nknowledge recall, they struggle with reasoning and\ntext generation. Meanwhile, for fully open-ended\nmedical text generation, human evaluation remains\nindispensable due to the exceptionally high stan-\ndards required. Our work provides a more accu-\nrate and reliable framework for assessing medical\nLLMs.\nLimitations\nDespite our comprehensive approach, LLMEval-\nMed has several limitations. First, while our dataset\ncovers five core medical dimensions, it primarily\nfocuses on Chinese medical contexts, which may\nlimit generalizability to other healthcare systems\nand languages.Second, our benchmark primarily\nevaluates text-based capabilities and does not incor-\nporate multimodal medical tasks involving images,\naudio, or other data types that are increasingly im-\nportant in clinical practice. Finally, as medical\nknowledge evolves rapidly, maintaining the bench-\nmark’s relevance will require regular updates to\nreflect current best practices and emerging medical\nconsensus.\nReferences\nAIIMS. 2025.

Leveraging summary guid-\nance on medical report summarization. Preprint ,\narXiv:2302.04001.\nA Annotation Process\nTo ensure the quality and reliability of our evalu-\nation benchmark, we implemented a rigorous an-\nnotation process involving qualified medical pro-\nfessionals. Our annotation team consisted of three\ndistinct groups of medical personnel:\n1.Practicing Physicians : Medical doctors from\nour research institution’s affiliated hospitals, bring-\ning clinical expertise and practical experience to\nthe evaluation process.\n2.Medical Faculty : Professors and instructors\nfrom medical schools who contributed their aca-\ndemic knowledge and educational perspective.\n3.Medical Students : Graduate-level medical\nstudents (minimum qualification: Master’s degree\ncandidates) who assisted in the annotation process\nunder supervision.\nEach annotator carefully reviewed materials ac-\ncording to specific task requirements. During both\nthe benchmark construction and refinement phases,\nannotators were provided with appropriate com-\npensation for their expertise and time commitment.\nThis multi-level annotation approach ensured com-\nprehensive evaluation across different medical ex-\npertise levels while maintaining high standards\nof quality control throughout the development of\nLLMEval-Med.\nB Data Sources\nAs shown in Table 4, we include a wide range of\npublicly available benchmark datasets.\nTable 5 lists the online user Q&A and consulta-\ntion sources, which are used to simulate real-world\ninteractions.\nIn Table 6, we provide clinical datasets from\nhospitals and medical institutions that contain real\npatient records and test results.\nWe collect guideline-based resources and author-\nitative medical literature as shown in Table 7.\nAdditional resources such as popular science ar-\nticles, hospital rankings, medical dictionaries, and\nquestion banks are summarized in Table 8.\n--- Page 12 ---\nNo. Source URL\n1.

This tripartite split follows the\nChinese Classification and Codes of Disciplines\n(Li Xiaolin et al., 2009) and the National Medi-\ncal Licensing Examination syllabus, which delin-\neates Basic Medical Sciences, Medical Humani-\nties (including Public Health), Clinical Medicine,\nand Preventive Medicine as distinct modules (CN-\nMLE, 2025). Grounding MK in these established\ncurricula avoids arbitrary knowledge domains and\nfocuses evaluation on the exact biomedical princi-\nples, diagnostic frameworks, and population-level\nstrategies that clinicians must master.\nUnder Medical Language Understanding\n(MLU) , LLMEvalMed tests six concrete NLP\ntasks—Information Extraction, Text Classification,\nTranslation Matching, Tabular Data Processing,\nMulti-turn Dialogue, and Summarization—that re-\nflect real-world clinical workflows. The CBLUE\nbenchmark’s entity recognition, relation extraction,\ndiagnosis normalization, and sentence-pair classi-\nfication tasks exemplify rigorous design for Chi-\nnese biomedical texts (Zhang et al., 2022), while\nthe BC5CDR corpus’s 1,500 PubMed abstracts an-\nnotated for 4,409 chemicals, 5,818 diseases, and\n3,116 chemical–disease interactions underscores\nthe centrality of extraction and relation labeling\n(Li et al., 2016). Large-scale dialogue datasets\nsuch as MedDialog (3.4 million Chinese and 0.26\nmillion English patient–doctor exchanges) further\ndemand evaluation of contextual comprehension\nand response coherence in clinical conversations\n(Zeng et al., 2020).TheMedical Reasoning (MR) category isolates\ninferential capacities—Symptom Diagnosis, Sci-\nentific Research, Efficacy Evaluation, and Treat-\nment Planning—that require integrating evidence\nand drawing clinically valid conclusions. Pub-\nMedQA, which compels reasoning over quanti-\ntative research abstracts to answer yes/no/maybe\nquestions, exemplifies the depth of interpretive\nskill needed for research-oriented inference (Jin\net al., 2019). LLMEvalMed also incorporates Med-\nBench’s \"Complex Medical Reasoning\" dimension,\ncovering tasks from patient inquiry through diag-\nnostic hypothesis generation to treatment plan for-\nmulation, thereby ensuring that models can navi-\ngate both everyday clinical reasoning and special-\nized research questions (Liu et al., 2024).\nInMedical Text Generation (MTG) , we\nevaluate creative synthesis through four sub-\ntasks—Rewriting, Generation, Summarization, and\nAbstracting—each reflecting different facets of\nclinical documentation. The DISCHARGE, ECHO,\nand RADIOLOGY corpora, with 50 K, 16 K, and\n378 K report–summary pairs respectively, provide\na concrete foundation for assessing abstractive sum-\nmarization across specialties (Zhu et al., 2023b).\nPromptCBLUE extends this by evaluating LLMs\non multi-task prompt-based generation, including\nentity-aware rewriting, structured report genera-\ntion, and dialogue content creation within biomed-\nical contexts (Zhu et al., 2023a). Together, these\nresources ensure LLMEvalMed measures both fi-\ndelity to source content and fluency in medically\nprecise generation.\nFinally, the Medical Safety & Ethics (MSE)\ncategory tests understanding of drug safety, pro-\nhibited practices, and intervention safety to uphold\npatient welfare and professional standards. Med-\nBench’s \"Healthcare Safety & Ethics\" dimension\nexplicitly examines model judgments on contraindi-\ncations and ethical dilemmas (Liu et al., 2024),\nwhile the WHO Expert Committee on Drug De-\npendence (ECDD) framework offers authoritative\ncriteria for evaluating psychoactive substance risks\nand therapeutic benefits (World Health Organiza-\ntion, 2019). By embedding these rigorous safety\nand ethics assessments, LLMEvalMed moves be-\nyond correctness and creativity to ensure models\noperate within the strict boundaries required for\nreal-world medical deployment.\n--- Page 26 ---\nG Case Study\nOur analysis of model performance across the five\nmedical evaluation categories reveals several con-\nsistent failure patterns that limit LLM effectiveness\nin healthcare applications. These patterns can be\ncategorized into four primary types of errors:\n1. Incomplete Knowledge Application: Mod-\nels frequently demonstrate partial understanding\nof medical concepts but fail to apply comprehen-\nsive knowledge. As shown in Table 19, Qwen2.5-\n32B correctly identified conjugation effects and\nhydrogen bonding but missed the critical electron-\nwithdrawing mechanisms affecting hydroxyl elec-\ntron density. Similarly, our analysis in Table 23\nreveals that both models identified some relevant\nregulations but omitted key Civil Code articles\n(1226/1032) that specifically address medical pri-\nvacy.\n2. Logical Inconsistency: Some models draw\nconclusions contradicting their own analysis. Ta-\nble 21 illustrates how Qwen-72B correctly ana-\nlyzed statistical data showing no significant dif-\nference between recommendation types (OR 1.40;\n95% CI 0.80-2.46) but then illogically concluded\nthat recommendation type affects compliance. This\ndemonstrates a failure in maintaining logical coher-\nence throughout complex medical reasoning tasks.\n3. Context Adherence Failures: In role-\nplaying scenarios, models struggle to consistently\nmaintain character traits and contextual require-\nments. The results in Table 20 demonstrate that o1-\nmini failed to follow the defensive-then-corrective\nsequence required for Sister Zhang’s character and\nlacked authentic dialect features, resulting in an un-\nconvincing portrayal despite capturing some basic\ncharacter elements.\n4. Format Violations: When tasked with gen-\nerating structured medical documentation, as ev-\nidenced in Table 22, DISC-MedLLM completely\nfailed to produce a proper medical record format,\ninstead offering generic advice. This model missed\ncritical clinical reasoning elements and failed to\nrecognize the urgency of potential deep vein throm-\nbosis in a patient with antiphospholipid syndrome\nhistory.\nThese patterns suggest that while LLMs can\ndemonstrate surface-level medical knowledge, they\noften struggle with comprehensive application, log-\nical consistency, contextual adherence, and domain-\nspecific formatting requirements. These limitations\nhighlight the need for specialized medical training,improved reasoning capabilities, and better con-\ntext management in future LLM based medical AI\nsystems.\n--- Page 27 ---\nMedical Knowledge\nQuestion Why is β-OH anthraquinone more acidic than α-OH anthraquinone?\nReference\nAnswerThe higher acidity of β-OH anthraquinone compared to α-OH anthraquinone is primarily\ndue to resonance effects, hydrogen bonding, and steric factors: 1. Resonance: In β-OH\nanthraquinone, the hydroxyl group’s position allows better delocalization of negative charge\nthrough the conjugated system, stabilizing the deprotonated form. 2. Hydrogen bonding:\nα-OH anthraquinone forms internal hydrogen bonds with adjacent carbonyl groups, making\nproton release more difficult. β-OH anthraquinone has less internal hydrogen bonding,\nfacilitating proton release. 3. Steric effects: The α-position’s proximity to the carbonyl group\ncreates steric hindrance, making deprotonation less favorable compared to the β-position. The\nβ-OH group’s conjugation with the carbonyl system reduces electron density on the hydroxyl\noxygen through electron-withdrawing effects, enhancing acidity.\nChecklist Core requirements :\n1. Content requirement: Explain why β-OH anthraquinone is more acidic, including enhanced\nresonance effect, reduced hydrogen bonding, and steric hindrance effects.\n2. Content requirement: Detail how the β-OH position stabilizes the deprotonated negative\nion through resonance effects, and how internal hydrogen bonding at the α-OH position\nreduces acidity.\nSecondary requirements :\n1.
