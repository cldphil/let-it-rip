One of\nthe ways in which we might address hate speech\nis by contextualizing through the use of counter-\nnarratives (CN), which can not only reinforce val-\nues like tolerance but also dispel misinformation\nabout the target groups. However, these modera-\ntion approaches have been criticized for being la-\nbor intensive, psychologically demanding (Xiang,\n2023; Chung et al., 2021), and highly inefficient\n(Godel et al., 2021), thus increasing the risk of\namplifying harmful rhetoric and misinformation\nthat can have serious ramifications. One scalable\nand ethically grounded strategy to mitigate these\nrisks, is through automatic CN generation: textual\nresponses designed to resist or contradict hateful\n*Primary and Corresponding author. Email:\nmikelkengni@gmail.com\nFigure 1: Research methodology showing dataset used,\nCN generation and evaluation strategies.\nlanguage (Chung et al., 2023; Schieb and Preuss,\n2016)1.\nWhile prior research on CN generation has em-\nphasized dataset development, generation meth-\nods, and overall effectiveness in mitigating hate\nspeech (Moscato et al., 2025; Bonaldi et al., 2023;\nTekiro ˘glu et al., 2020), little attention has been\npaid to affective attributes such as emotion and\nsentiment. Affect is deeply linked to hate speech\n(Plaza-del-Arco et al., 2022; Plaza-del Arco et al.,\n2021) and can shape how these responses are re-\nceived by different groups.\nTo address this gap, we present a comprehen-\nsive evaluation framework for analyzing LLMs-\ngenerated CNs across four key dimensions: (1)\nPersona framing (Vanilla, NGO professional, and\na Compassionate NGO professional), recognizing\nthat delivery style can influence impact; (2) Model\nbehavior (e.g., refusal rates, verbosity and readabil-\nity); (3) Affective tone (sentiment and emotion);\nand (4) Ethical risk (potential for generating hateful\ncontent). This multi-dimensional approach offers a\nnuanced understanding of both the capabilities and\nimplications of using LLMs in high-stakes content\n1Warning : The content in this paper may be offensive or\nupsetting.\n--- Page 2 ---\nmoderation settings.\nContributions We conduct experiments2on two\ndatasets using three state-of-the-art LLMs, Ope-\nnAI’s GPT-4o-Mini (Hurst et al., 2024); Cohere’s\nCommandR-7B-12-20243; and Meta’s LLaMA 3.1-\n70B (Grattafiori et al., 2024), hereafter referred\nas GPT, Cohere, and Llama respectively. Each\nmodel is tested under three prompting conditions:\n(1) Vanilla, where the model is prompted without\nany explicit persona conditioning or additional in-\nstructions beyond the default system behavior; (2)\nNGO-Persona Prompting, where the model adopts\nthe persona of an NGO worker countering hate\nspeech; and (3) Emotion-Driven Persona Prompt-\ning, where the NGO-Persona is further refined with\nexplicit emotional guidance.\nOur findings reveal an inverse relationship be-\ntween verbosity and readability, and also high-\nlights the importance of a human in CN creation\nto ensure CNs remain accessible for diverse au-\ndience . While LLMs demonstrate strong affective\nclassification capabilities, they also exhibit ethical\nand computational vulnerabilities. These findings\ncontribute to the growing discourse on the safe,\nresponsible, and inclusive deployment of gener-\native AI in high-stakes domains, particularly in\ndeveloping more targeted responses to effectively\ncountering hate speech across different population\ndemographics.\n2 Related Work\nPrior research on automated CN generation has\nlargely focused on three areas: dataset develop-\nment (Bonaldi et al., 2024, 2022; Vallecillo Ro-\ndríguez et al., 2024), response generation (Bonaldi\net al., 2025), and evaluation frameworks (Saha\net al., 2024; Ashida and Komachi, 2022; Piot and\nParapar, 2024).\nDataset Creation: Vallecillo Rodríguez et al.\n(2024) expanded the MultiTarget CONAN (MT-\nConan) dataset (Fanton et al., 2021) into Spanish\nand assessed LLM-generated responses on this\ndataset. They manually evaluate the responses\nbased on offensiveness, stance, informativeness,\nand other linguistics cues to analyze the verbosity\nof different GPT models across various target\ngroups. However, the study focused solely on\n2The Codes, datasets, LLM responses, and results are avail-\nable at https://github.com/MikelKN/WOAH-2025\n3https://docs.cohere.com/v2/docs/command-r7bGPT models using a vanilla prompting strategy.\nSimilarly focusing on GPT models and the MT-\nConan dataset, Ashida and Komachi (2022), ex-\nplored LLMs’ effectiveness in mitigating both ex-\nplicit and implicit hate speech. Their evaluation,\nwhich considered content diversity, verbosity, and\nresponse quality, showed that GPT models (ver-\nsions 3+) effectively produce humanly sound, in-\nformative responses but often struggle with detect-\ning and generating responses for implicit hateful\ncontent.\nResponse Generation and Evaluation: Saha\net al. (2024) examined LLMs’ ability to generate\nCNs with vanilla prompting using GPT-2 (Rad-\nford et al., 2019), DialoGPT (Zhang et al., 2020),\nChatGPT4, and a FlanT5 (Chung et al., 2024).\nTheir study employed three structured prompting\nstrategies and assessed LLM responses using mul-\ntiple evaluation metrics, including checking toxi-\ncity levels, and readability scores. Reported find-\nings shows GPT models tend to produce contents\nwith low readability scores and that while strategic\nprompting can improve narrative quality, it may\nalso increase the risk of generating toxic responses.\nThese concerns are echoed by Piot et al. (2024),\nwho systematically assess the propensity of LLMs\nto produce harmful content. Their study uses the\nMT-Conan dataset to evaluate eight LLMs (includ-\ning GPT, Llama, Vicuna, Mistral, and Gemini fam-\nilies) under vanilla prompting conditions, employ-\ning the MetaHateBERT model to detect hateful con-\ntent. Their findings revealed that certain models,\nparticularly Llama-2 and Mistral, frequently gener-\nated toxic outputs even without explicit prompts.\nA study closely related to ours is presented by\nCima et al. (2025), who propose a method for gen-\nerating CN that are both community-adapted and\npersonalized for individual users. Their approach\nleverages only the Llama2-13B models, in a vanilla\nstate and evaluates generated responses based on\nrange of personalized and ethical criteria including\ntoxicity, readability, relevance, and response diver-\nsity. Their findings reveal a significant misalign-\nment between automatic metrics and human judg-\nments, suggesting that these approaches capture dif-\nferent dimensions of response quality. This under-\nscores the importance of developing more nuanced\nand multifaceted evaluation frameworks, an insight\nthat directly motivates our multi-dimensional as-\nsessment strategy.\n4https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/\n--- Page 3 ---\nWhile these studies provide valuable insights\ninto LLM-based CN generation and evaluation,\nour work extends this research by introducing\nnovel Persona- and emotion-conditioned prompt-\ning strategies beyond standard vanilla prompts;\nsentiment, emotion, and behavioral evaluations in-\ncluding refusal rates, hatefulness, and readability;\nCross-model and cross-dataset comparisons to as-\nsess generalizability.\n3 Methodology\nIn this section, we describe the datasets, prompts,\nevaluation metrics and models used. See Figure 1\nfor an overview of our research methodology.\n3.1 Datasets\nOur experiments utilizes the MT-Conan (Fanton\net al., 2021) and HatEval (Basile et al., 2019).\nThese datasets were selected for their complemen-\ntary strengths: both are publicly accessible, contain\ndiverse hate speech examples across multiple target\ndemographics, and represent a blend of real-world\ncontent.\nMT-Conan comprises 5,003 pairs of hate speech\nand professionally generated CNs. These CNs\nwere created by NGO workers following a semi-\nautomatic approach. The dataset is in English, con-\ntains diverse labels describing the protected classes\ntargeted by hate speech, and is publicly available\non GitHub.5\nThe HatEval dataset6, initially developed for the\nSemEval-2019 Task 5, focuses on hate speech tar-\ngeting women and immigrants on Twitter. While\nthe original dataset is distributed in both English\nand Spanish, for our work we use a randomly sam-\npled subset of 2,000 instances from the combined\nEnglish development and training data. Unlike the\nmore structured text in MT-Conan, HatEval con-\ntains authentic social media conversations, provid-\ning a more natural testing ground. Together, these\ndatasets offer complementary challenges for CN\ngeneration, allowing us to evaluate our prompting\ntechniques across different hate speech contexts\nand linguistic structures.\n3.2 Prompt Strategies\nOur model selection criteria focused on models\nthat strike a balance between performance, and\naccessibility, and cost-effectiveness. We choose\n5https://github.com/marcoguerini/conan\n6https://github.com/cicl2018/HateEvalTeamGPT and Cohere as our main closed-source mod-\nels, , and the most commonly used open-source\nmodel, Llama. For each, we employ three different\nprompting strategies:\n1.Vanilla : We prompt the LLM without any\nexplicit persona conditioning or additional in-\nstructions beyond the default system behavior,\nusing a prompting approach similar to Valle-\ncillo Rodríguez et al. (2024).\n2.NGO-Persona : We instruct the LLM to adopt\nthe persona of an NGO worker attempting to\nmitigate hateful language online.\n3.NGO-Emotion : We extend the NGO-Persona\nprompt to also specify the emotional tone of\nthe CN by explicitly directing the model to\ngenerate responses that are compassionate.\nThe format of the persona prompts are adapted\nfrom Gupta et al. (2023). The details on prompting\nstrategies are provided in Appendix C - Table 8\nwhile Table 13 shows a representative example of\nmodel outputs for each strategy.\n3.3 Evaluation Method Description\nWe present a multi-faceted evaluation framework\nthat analyzes LLM-generated CNs along sentiment\nand emotion attributes, refusal and readability, and\nthe potential to generate hate.\nEmotion analysis with RoBERTa We leverage\na RoBERTa-based model fine-tuned on the GoE-\nmotions dataset for multi-label classification.7The\nGoEmotions dataset (Demszky et al., 2020) com-\nprises 58,000 carefully curated Reddit comments la-\nbeled across 27 emotion categories The RoBERTa\nmodel has demonstrated state-of-the-art perfor-\nmance on various NLP tasks due to its robust pre-\ntraining on large-scale data and combined with this\ndataset, the model has shown remarkable adaptabil-\nity and accuracy, hence making it well-suited for\nnuanced emotion recognition like those that can be\npresent in the MT-Conan and HatEval datasets.\nSentiment analysis with DistilBERT We uti-\nlize a pre-trained DistilBERT-based uncased model\ntrained on synthetically generated data8. The\nmodel categorizes sentiment into: Very Negative,\nNegative, Neutral, Positive, Very Positive.\n7https://huggingface.co/SamLowe/\nroberta-base-go_emotions\n8https://huggingface.co/tabularisai/\nrobust-sentiment-analysis\n--- Page 4 ---\nSentiment and emotion analysis with MistralAI\n(Mistral) We also consider sentiment and emo-\ntion classification using LLMs, given their perfor-\nmance on the task (Neši ´c et al., 2024). For this task,\nwe utilize a fine-tuned version of the Mistral 7B\nmodel - mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 (Jiang\net al., 2023)9. The overall goal is to compare the\nsentiment and emotion distribution of generated\nCN from both transformer-based and LLM-based\nperspectives, thus allowing for a more compre-\nhensive and accurate analysis of affects variations.\nThis will enable us to also gain deeper insights\ninto the tone, potential reach, and overall impact of\nthese CNs.\nAssessing hatefulness scores Finally, follow-\ning Piot and Parapar’s observation that prominent\nLLMs tend to generate hateful comments, we inves-\ntigate their claims using the same MetaHateBERT\nmodel they employed. MetaHateBERT is a BERT-\nbased hate speech classification model trained on\na large corpus of synthetic hate speech datasets\nand data from more diverse social network settings,\nand has demonstrated strong performance in hate\nspeech detection (Piot et al., 2024).\n4 Results\n4.1 Word-level Metrics\nVerbosity We calculate verbosity for each mod-\nels and datasets as the length of the response in\nterms of the number of words. (see Table 1).\nAcross all models, the vanilla prompt consis-\ntently produces shorter responses. We find that\npersona-based instructions tend to increase ver-\nbosity. The highest verbosity observed in NGO-\nEmotion prompt suggests that LLMs tend to re-\nspond to emotionally rich prompts with more\ndetailed and expressive CNs.\nAt the model level, in our vanilla setting on\nthe HatEval dataset, the Cohere model generates\nthe longest responses, averaging 74 words per re-\nsponse, compared to 60 and 44 words for GPT and\nLlama, respectively. We observe that all three mod-\nels exhibit similar verbosity levels when prompted\nwith the NGO-Persona. Notably, all models pro-\nduce significantly longer responses on the NGO-\nEmotion prompt, with Llama being the most ver-\nbose. A similar trend is observed with the MT-\nConan dataset, where responses are generally more\n9Mistral https://huggingface.co/mistralai/\nMistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2Data Source Persona Dataset\nHatEval MT-Conan\nOriginal Input\nText - 22.6 13.2\nCounter-narrative Human NGO - 24.8\nLLM generated responses\nGPT Vanilla 60.4 72.2\nGPT NGO-Persona 80.0 88.9\nGPT NGO-Emotion 96.4 100.6\nLlama Vanilla 44.3 51.5\nLlama NGO-Persona 77.4 106.4\nLlama NGO-Emotion 102.3 121.8\nCohere Vanilla 74.0 64.8\nCohere NGO-Persona 79.6 92.8\nCohere NGO-Emotion 91.7 98.1\nTable 1: Distribution of mean word count - largest val-\nues in Bold while least values in italics .\nverbose – except for the Cohere model under the\nvanilla prompt, where Llama again generates the\nlongest responses.\nInterestingly, there is a contradiction in the mean\nword length of the original dataset texts: HatE-\nval’s original text ( 22.6) is almost twice that of\nMT-Conan ( 13.6), yet LLM-generated responses\nfor HatEval tend to be less verbose. This behav-\nior could be attributed to the explicit nature of the\nHatEval dataset, which may lead LLMs to adopt\na more cautious approach, restricting verbosity to\navoid generating inappropriate content.\nReadability To assess readability, and the lit-\neracy level required to understand the LLM-\ngenerated responses, we use the Flesch Reading\nEase and Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level metrics\n(Flesch, 2007). Overall, responses across all mod-\nels tend to be difficult to read and typically re-\nquire a college-level reading ability . However,\nthe Cohere model consistently produces the most\nreadable texts, with the highest reading ease scores\nand the lowest required reading grade levels across\nall prompting strategies and datasets, followed by\nresponses from Llama and then GPT models as\nthe least suitable for readers with lower literacy\nlevels. We find similar trends for the HateEval\ndataset, see Figure 2 and Figure 4 from Appendix\nC for more detailed results for the MT-Conan and\nHatEval dataset. These findings are particularly\nimportant because they reveal how responses gen-\nerated by some commercial LLMs can be ex-\nclusionary for marginalized groups who might\nbenefit most from accessible CN .Thus reinforc-\ning broader patterns of systemic AI bias (Ngueajio\n--- Page 5 ---\nFigure 2: MT-Conan: Flesch Reading Ease and Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level score across all models and persona.\nand Washington, 2022), where AI systems tend to\nunder perform for certain populations.\nWe also observe an inverse relation between\nverbosity and readability. The prompts framed\nwith NGO-Emotion, despite being the most ver-\nbose yield the most readable outputs, followed by\nvanilla prompts and then NGO-Persona. This sug-\ngests that prompts with emotional framing con-\ntribute to more accessible language . Specifically,\nthe vanilla and NGO-persona prompts appears to\nelicit more academically complex responses on the\nMT-Conan and HatEval dataset respectively.\nThe original human-authored CNs from the MT-\nConan dataset yielded a Flesch Reading Ease score\nof59.6 and a Flesch–Kincaid grade level of 8.7 un-\nderscores the continued importance of human-\nin-the-loop approaches in CN generation, par-\nticularly for ensuring that content remains ac-\ncessible and effective for broader audiences of\ndifferent literacy levels.\n4.2 Refusal Rates\nWe designed regular expressions (see A.1) based on\ncommon refusal phrases observed in model outputs.\nWe calculate the models’ refusal rates as the pro-\nportion of inputs that matched any of these patterns.\nWe only find refusals for Cohere in the HatEval\ndataset at the rate of 0.9%, 0.05% and 0.1% for the\nvanilla, NGO-Persona and NGO-Emotion use cases\nrespectively. A deeper analysis of the content that\ntriggers a refusal from the Cohere model reveals\nthat the LLM is particularly sensitive to explicit\nwords such as \"b**tch,\" \"h*e,\" and \"wh*re\". These\nwords also sometimes cause the model to deviate\nfrom the intended task. Notably, when encounter-\ning the B-word, the Cohere model often adopts the\npersona of the victim rather than providing a CNas can be seen in some examples in Table 10 in the\nAppendix C. These findings support our hypothesis\nthat HateEval is the more explicit dataset.\n4.3 Sentiment Analysis\nSentiment analysis with DistilBERT We ob-\nserve from Table 2 that the majority of responses\nare classified as Neutral, indicating a tendency to-\nward non-polarized outputs. Notably, the HatE-\nval dataset exhibits the highest proportion of Neu-\ntral responses, with the NGO-Emotion prompt\nyielding the most Neutral outputs across both\ndatasets—except for the Cohere model. In con-\ntrast, the higher proportion of Positive and Very\nPositive responses in the MT-Conan dataset sug-\ngests that LLMs may be more inclined to generate\nconstructive CNs in this context. This discrepancy\nmay be attributed to the explicit nature of HatE-\nval, which appears to make models more cautious,\nleading to more constrained responses. Moreover,\na small proportion of the original text (15%) and\nhuman generated CNs (2.9%) are classified as very\npositive-False Positives.\nSentiment analysis with Mistral On Mistral, we\nobserve significantly larger proportion of positive\nsentiment attribution comparatively. GPT consis-\ntently generates the most positive CNs, particu-\nlarly with the NGO-Emotion prompt, while Cohere\ngenerates more neutral and slightly more negative\nresponses overall. From a persona perspective,\nprompting with NGO-Emotion significantly en-\nhances positive sentiment across the board thus\ncorroborating the outcomes from RoBERTa. Thus,\nsuggesting that explicit emotional guidance in-\nfluences LLM outputs effectively.\nThe outcome of the RoBERTa model somewhat\naligns with that of Mistral in terms of sentiment\n--- Page 6 ---\nNeg (%) Neut (%) Pos (%) V .Neg (%) V .Pos (%)\nData Source Persona H C H C H C H C H C\nOriginal Input\nOriginal Text - 5.55 19.52 23.1 16.41 2.8 0.40 53.5 60.79 15.05 2.92\nCounter-narrative - - 14.16 - 56.27 - 2.26 - 22.18 - 5.18\nLLM generated responses\nGPT Vanilla 1.05 0.52 82.85 49.71 1.45 4.34 7.90 12.59 6.75 32.87\nGPT NGO-Persona 4.90 1.26 79.65 67.46 0.95 2.48 13.30 17.19 1.20 11.66\nGPT NGO-Emotion 2.80 0.44 86.65 84.48 1.25 2.32 7.85 6.74 1.45 6.06\nLlama Vanilla 3.80 0.76 70.40 51.52 2.50 9.22 12.20 9.62 11.10 28.90\nLlama NGO-Persona 7.70 2.44 70.45 58.14 1.55 3.82 17.80 29.38 2.55 6.26\nLlama NGO-Emotion 6.80 1.84 81.05 80.36 2.65 6.46 6.30 7.54 3.20 3.84\nCohere Vanilla 3.80 0.56 70.40 44.07 2.50 3.74 12.20 30.03 11.10 21.60\nCohere NGO-Persona 4.00 0.26 79.80 36.32 2.40 1.10 10.90 47.66 3.00 14.70\nCohere NGO-Emotion 2.95 1.16 75.60 69.66 2.80 2.54 15.05 16.32 3.55 10.34\nTable 2: Sentiment distribution (%) using DistilBERT for HatEval (H, n= 2000 ) and MT-Conan (C, n= 5003 ).\nBolded values indicate the highest sentiment scores for the LLM generated CN while redis the largest scores for\nthe original text and human generated CN for both datasets.\nNeg (%) Neut (%) Pos (%) V .Neg (%) V .Pos (%)\nData Source Persona H C H C H C H C H C\nOriginal Input\nOriginal Text - 37.03 16.70 3.85 2.82 8.35 0.34 50.75 80.18 0 0\nCounter-narrative - - 20.74 - 40.85 - 33.14 - 5.32 - 0\nLLM generated responses\nGPT Vanilla 0.65 1.78 0.80 2.38 98.35 95.55 0.2 0.32 0 0\nGPT NGO-Persona 2.75 0.7 1.85 1.22 94.25 97.60 1.15 0.54 0 0\nGPT NGO-Emotion 0.55 0.08 1.60 0.62 97.8 99.34 0.05 0 0 0.02\nLlama Vanilla 3.60 2.06 4.05 3.54 91.95 93.96 0.40 0.48 0 0\nLlama NGO-Persona 6.85 5.64 5.90 1.86 86.0 91.13 1.25 1.40 0 0\nLlama NGO-Emotion 2.30 0.82 8.05 1.70 89.55 97.49 0.10 0.04 0 0\nCohere Vanilla 11.80 7.0 13.60 5.18 62.65 81.53 11.90 6.32 0.05 0.02\nCohere NGO-Persona 11.4 5.72 3.75 1.02 76.70 89.20 8.10 4.04 0.05 0.06\nCohere NGO-Emotion 3.15 1.58 7.40 2.16 88.35 95.72 1.10 0.6 0 0\nTable 3: Sentiment distribution (%) using Mistral.

Thus indicating that Mistral identifies\na strong association between hate speech and\nanger , reinforcing existing research (Ghenai et al.,\n2025) that highlights anger and negative sentiment\nas a dominant affective tones in hateful discourse.\nMoreover, it also suggests that model choice can\nsignificantly impact emotion analysis. Figure 8 and\n9 show the distribution of top emotions as predicted\nby RoBERTa and Mistral.\nThe emotion outcome of Mistral aligns\nRoBERTa’s neutral emotion classification 73.5%\nand 71.6% of the time for the MT-Conan and HatE-\nval datasets, respectively. This could be evidence\nthat both models potentially may have limita-\ntions in distinguishing implicit hate speech from\n--- Page 7 ---\nFigure 3: Relationship between hate speech emotions and responses generated by the Cohere model in the vanilla\n(left) NGO persona + empathy (right) setting for the MT-Conan dataset. Top 5 emotions based prediction with\nMistral are shown.\ntruly neutral statements . A deeper investigation\ninto the 7% Mistral neutral emotion label to deter-\nmine the nature of the neutral emotion labeled by\nboth models reveals that many of the statements\nexpress prejudice, stereotypes, and exclusionary\nbeliefs targeting marginalized groups, which are\ntypically associated with negative emotions.\nEmotion analysis of counter-narratives with\nRoBERTa Analyzing both datasets, Approval\nemerges as the top emotion. Interestingly, among\nthe top positive emotions, we find gratitude, admi-\nration, love, and caring for the MT-Conan dataset,\nandadmiration ,caring, gratitude, joy andcu-\nriosity for the HatEval dataset, emotions that may\nnot always be expected or ideal for CNs. Thus\nhinting to the fact that the models often frame\ntheir CNs in a positive or empathetic tone, even\nwhen addressing explicit hate speech .\nFor instance, looking into CNs expressing admi-\nration, we notice that instead of directly refuting\nthe hateful content, the model often tried to posi-\ntively re frame the discussion aiming to de-escalate\nhostility and foster constructive dialogue. While\nthis affirmation-based approach can be effective in\ncertain cases, its suitability for explicit and severe\nforms of hate speech remains uncertain. Addition-\nally, among the positive emotions labels e.g. love,\nand joy, we notice that these labels may be an arti-\nfact of the emotion classifier itself. Specifically, the\nclassifier appeared to over-rely on certain lexical\ncues, such as \"fun\", \"happy\", \"party\", \"cele-\nbrate\", and \"enjoy\", in response labeled as ’joy’,\nwhich can inadvertently bias its classification to-\nward positive emotions, even in contexts where\nthey may not be appropriate . This highlightsa key limitation in automated emotion detection\nand emphasizes the need for more context-aware\ntechniques when evaluating CNs.\nEmotion analysis with Mistral Caring and ap-\nproval consistently emerged as the top emotions\nacross nearly all response. For HatEval, admira-\ntion, joy, and love often rounded out the top five,\nwhereas joy, love, admiration, and gratitude were\nmost commonly observed in MT-Conan.\nMoreover, we notice that most responses gener-\nated by Cohere’s vanilla had the largest proportion\n(5.9%-HatEval and 5.5%-MT-Conan) of emotions\nlabeled \"love\" by both Mistral and RoBERTa. A\ncloser inspection revealed that these classifications\nwere largely driven by surface-level lexical in-\ndicators, particularly the frequent inclusion of\nthe word “love” in the generated responses . See\nFigures 8 and 9 for the top four emotion predicted\nwith RoBERTa and Mistral.\nIn terms of the effect of prompts, in all cases\nthe vanilla setting shows the most diversity of emo-\ntions. With the introduction of the NGO persona\nthe emotions become more strongly positive: CNs\ngenerated using the NGO-Persona predominantly\nexhibited caring as the dominant emotion (see Fig-\nure 3). This suggests that the responses with the\nNGO-Persona, may be designed to foster empathy\nand support, whereas the vanilla persona responses\nlean towards validation and agreement, possibly\nrelating to models’ sycophancy.\nFor MT-Conan, we can compare the model’s re-\nsponses to expert-written ones. These generally\nrespond neutrally, but also show some approval,\nand care. Curiosity is also among the most com-\nmon emotions and this is unique to experts. While\n--- Page 8 ---\nthe emotions are overwhelmingly positive, we note\nthat both the NGO workers and Cohere sometimes\nrespond with anger. See Figure 5 and 7 in the\nAppendix B. Overall, models show more positive\nemotions than experts when responding to hate\nspeech across settings, with the exception of Co-\nhere’s model in the vanilla setting.\nOverall, we find that the choice of prompting\nstrategy has an notable effect on the affect of the\nresponses. Figures 6, 7 and 9 and Tables 11, Ap-\npendix C provide more details.\n4.5 Hatefulness Scores\nAnother important consideration is ensuring that\nthe CNs generated do not inadvertently perpetuate\nhate or harm toward users. As demonstrated by\nPiot and Parapar (2024), models like Llama, GPT\nand Mistral can produce a significant amount of\nhateful content when prompted with a vanilla ap-\nproach. We investigate these claims by assess the\nhatefulness scores of LLM-generated CNs using\nMetaHateBERT (Piot et al., 2024), following the\nmethodology outlined by the original authors.\nDataset Model Vanilla NGO-Persona NGO-Emotion\nHatEval GPT 0.56 0.65 0.46\nHatEval Cohere 3.04 1.54 1.25\nHatEval Llama 0.53 0.44 0.19\nMT-Conan GPT 2.99 3.00 1.48\nMT-Conan Cohere 5.61 4.79 2.22\nMT-Conan Llama 0.20 0.17 0.12\nTable 4: Hatefulness Scores (%) as Predicted by Meta-\nHateBERT. Highest scores in Bold .\nOur findings (See Table 4, Appendix B) indi-\ncate that the Cohere model generates the highest\npercentage of CNs classified as hateful by the\nMetaHateBERT model , whereas the Llama model\nproduces the lowest. We also documented (see Ta-\nble 6) some instance where Cohere generate hateful\nor inappropriate responses and in some cases even\nassumes the role of the victim of the hateful lan-\nguage.\nHowever, a closer examination reveals that the\nelevated hatefulness scores may stem from Meta-\nHateBERT’s difficulty in distinguishing between\ngenuine hate speech and CNs that merely refer-\nence or condemn hateful content . In many cases,\nelevated hatefulness scores occurred when CNs di-\nrectly referenced or restated parts of the original\nhateful text in an attempt to refute them. Since\nMetaHateBERT likely prioritizes certain keywords,\nit may misclassify these CNs as hateful, despitetheir intent being the opposite. A few examples of\nthis can be seen in Table 12, Appendix C.\n5 Discussion\nAutomated CN generation presents a nuanced and\ncomplex challenge. Our multi-faceted evaluation\nreveals several critical insights about LLM prompt-\ning, responses and performance.\nModel size vs Performance: Despite being the\nsmallest model with training size of 7 billion param-\neters compared to 70 billion, Llama and 20 billion\nfor GPT-4o-mini, Cohere Command-R consistently\ngenerated the most readable and accessible CN\nacross all experimental conditions. Thus challeng-\ning the assumption that bigger models always yield\nbetter results.\nCost vs Capability: Another striking observa-\ntion is that Cohere proved to be the most cost-\neffective model accessed through API call while\nLlama was the most expensive. Moreover, despite\nbeing open-sourced and accessible without API\ncalls, Mistral proved exponentially costly and re-\nquired significantly more processing time, even\non the fast Google Colab-NVIDIA A100 80GB\nHigh-Ram environment. Thus making them less\nfeasible in low-resource settings, undermining its\npracticality for system scalability and deployment.\nDual edge nature of emotion guiding: We\nequally observed that prompts framed with NGO-\nEmotion consistently produced more verbose, em-\npathetic, and paradoxically more readable re-\nsponses, suggesting that emotional context may\nserve as a valuable signal for generating more elab-\norate, persuasive and accessible responses. Despite\nCohere’s capacity at producing the most accessi-\nble response, it is the most prone to behavioral\ninconsistencies sometimes refusing to respond or\nproducing inappropriate content when processing\nsensitive content. These findings highlight per-\nsistent challenges in AI safety and alignment for\nmoderation applications.\nLLM’s superior understanding of contextual\ncues: Our experiments reveal that LLM-based\nemotion classification with Mistral exhibit a\nstronger ability to interpret emotional cues in text\ncompared to traditional BERT-based emotion detec-\ntion models. This performance gap is understand-\nably due to the significantly larger parameter size\nand training corpus of LLMs, which afford them\n--- Page 9 ---\ngreater contextual reasoning abilities. However,\nwe also observed that even the more sophisticated\nLLM-based emotion detection models sometimes\nfailed to identify implicit hateful cues as seen in Ta-\nble 12 in Appendix C, thus emphasizing a critical\nlimitations of using LLMs for affective measures.\nLimitation of hate speech classification systems:\nAnother important insight is that hate classification\nmodels like MetaHateBERT struggle to reliably\ndistinguish between actual hate speech and CN\nthat reference or explicitly condemn such content.\nThey often rely heavily on surface-level lexical\ncues such as trigger words which can lead to in-\nflated hatefulness scores (see Table 4 in Appendix\nC), thus raising concerns about false positives in\nautomated moderation pipelines. Such misclassi-\nfications could have serious implications in inad-\nvertently censoring the very responses meant to\nchallenge or de-escalate harmful discourse, under-\nmining their intended purpose.\nImplications of Human-AI collaboration: Our\nanalysis on LLM verbosity and readability show\na striking difference between human and LLM-\ngenerated content. Specifically, human-authored\nnarratives are often written at a Grade 8 reading\nlevel while most LLM-generated outputs generally\nrequire college-level comprehension. This raises\nimportant questions about accessibility and sug-\ngests that conciseness may be a more impactful\nstrategy in some contexts.\nThese observed trade-offs : readability vs. ver-\nbosity, cost vs. capability, emotional guiding vs.\nconsistency, suggest that no single model currently\nprovides an optimal solution across all dimensions.\nInstead, our results point toward hybrid approaches\nwhere LLMs help generate responses that are sub-\nsequently reviewed, refined, or selected by human\nmoderators.Thus underscoring the continued neces-\nsity of human oversight in automated CN genera-\ntion and content moderation.\n6 Future work\nAn interesting avenue to explore would be extend-\ning this evaluation framework to multimodal hate\nspeech scenarios to assess how LLMs responses\ndiffer from those in a uni-modal settings, could\nhelp shed light on the strengths and limitations of\ncurrent models in real-world moderation tasks and\ninform the development of more robust, context-\naware CN systems across different real world con-tent modalities.\nMoreover, research has shown that fake news\noften amplifies hate speech (Ngueajio et al., 2025).\nOur Future work will explore dual-purpose CN de-\nsigned to simultaneously correct factual inaccura-\ncies while neutralizing harmful framing. Address-\ning these intertwined challenges holistically can\nhelp create more efficient interventions strategies\nthan current approaches that tackle hate speech and\nfake news separately.\n7 Conclusion\nOur work highlights the complexity and high stakes\ninvolved in automating CNs to combat online hate\nspeech. Our findings show that while LLMs are\ncapable of generating emotionally nuanced and\nreadable responses, they often do so at the cost of\nverbosity and reduced accessibility, especially for\npeople without college education. We also show\nthat while cost-effective models like Cohere hold\npromise for broader deployment, their behavioral\nunpredictability remains a challenge which needs\nto be investigated thoroughly before leveraging\nthem for such tasks. As the use of generative AI\nexpands into sensitive domains like hate speech\nmitigation and content moderation, ensuring that\nresponses are not only accurate but also accessible,\nempathetic, and safe will be critical to fostering\ntruly inclusive and responsible AI.\nLimitations and Ethical Consideration\nDespite using a fixed temperature for each model,\nLLMs can produce varying outputs across runs,\nwhich affects reproducibility and consistency. For\nexample, Mistral often failed to adhere to emo-\ntional guidance, generating unintended affective\ntones. This required additional steering techniques\n(see Appendix A.2) to guide the model toward de-\nsired outputs. In a small number of instances (fewer\nthan 0.5% across all models), where Mistral still\nfailed to follow the prompt as intended, the input\nand prompt were manually submitted to the Mistral\nLeChat interface10to obtain the appropriate affect\nresponse. This intervention introduces a degree of\nhuman intervention which could affect the consis-\ntency and automation of our evaluation pipeline.\nFurthermore, our study focused exclusively on\nEnglish-language hate speech, specifically target-\ning immigrants and women. As such, the gen-\neralizability of our findings to other languages,\n10https://chat.mistral.ai/chat\n--- Page 10 ---\ncultural contexts, or hate speech targeting differ-\nent groups remains limited. Additionally, while\nwe used the full MT-Conan dataset, we randomly\nsampled only 2,000 instances from the HatEval\ndataset. A decision that was primarily driven by the\ncomputational and financial demands of querying\nlarge-scale LLMs across multiple prompt condi-\ntions. The HatEval sample was intended to provide\na secondary validation of our findings on more ex-\nplicit textual hate speech but we acknowledge that a\nfull-dataset evaluation could further strengthen the\ngeneralizability of our conclusions. Future work\ncan expand this analysis to include more dataset ex-\namples and additional languages or target groups.\nFrom an ethical perspective, although we assess\nand document the models’ ability to generate CNs,\nwe do not evaluate their real-world impact in re-\nducing hate speech or at improving social media\nusers behaviors and emotional intelligence. Future\nwork could help design better measure and metrics\nfor determining the effectiveness of different CN\nstrategies from these different methods in mitigat-\ning online toxicity.\nMore importantly, caution should be taken when\nconsidering to deploy AI-generated CNs, as has\nbeen shown in Table 12, language models like co-\nhere can inadvertently reinforce biases or generate\nunintended harmful content thus undermining the\nvery goals they’re meant to serve.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was partially supported by the Ama-\nzon (AWS) PhD Research Fellowship Awarded to\nMikel K.

In such case, the pre-\ndicted LLM emotion would be mapped to the clos-\nest match. For example, \"anxiety\" and \"unease\"\nwere mapped to \"nervousness,\" \"urgency\" and \"con-\ncern\" to \"fear,\" \"empathy,\" \"compassion,\" and \"un-\nderstanding\" to \"caring,\", other emotions such as\n\"nostalgia\", \"dismay\", \"shock\", \"resignation\", \"ap-\npreciation\" , \"respect\" and \"determination\" were all\nrespectively mapped to \"realization\", \"disappoint-\nment\", \"surprise\",\"sadness\", \"gratitude\", \"admira-\ntion\", and \"optimism\".\nB Model Descriptions\nB.1 CommandR-7B\nThe CommandR-7B-12-2024 model used in this\nproject is the latest iteration of Cohere’s R-series\nmodels. It is the smallest and fastest model in\nthe series, operating exclusively on text. With a\ncontext window of 128K tokens, this model ex-\ncels at tasks such as retrieval-augmented genera-\ntion (RAG), tool use, agent-based applications, and\nother scenarios that require complex, multi-step\nreasoning. Moreover, it demonstrates improved\nsafety and more robust guardrails compared to its\npredecessor (command) described as a high quality,\nmore reliably model and with a 4k context. The\ncommand models was initially used for this project\nbut exhibited instances of hate speech and explicit\nlanguage so we decided to use this models as it was\nmore recently released, to fair comparison with\nllama and GPT models. The model was equally\naccessed via API. Table 6 shows a few examples of\ninstances where cohere produce hateful language\nand ineffective advice from the HatEval dataset.\nB.2 GPT-4o-mini\nGPT4o-mini is the latest addition to OpenAI’s\nmodel family, launched in late 2024. It distin-\nguishes itself as a cost-effective and compact lan-\nguage model that supports both text and vision\nmodalities.

They often fill labor gaps, take on challenging roles, and create\nopportunities for others.\nLlama Vanilla Migrants fill labor gaps, contribute to economic growth, and pay taxes, helping to\nfund public services that benefit everyone in the community.\nGPT NGO-Persona The idea that migrants steal our jobs overlooks the complex realities of labor\nmarkets. In fact, migrants often fill essential roles that are hard to fill, contributing\nto economic growth and job creation. They bring diverse skills and perspectives\nthat can enhance innovation and productivity. Rather than viewing migration as\na threat, we should recognize it as an opportunity to build a more dynamic and\nresilient economy. By fostering collaboration and understanding, we can create a\nsociety where everyone, regardless of their background, can thrive and contribute\nto our shared prosperity.\nCohere NGO-Persona We must recognize that migration is a natural process, driven by the pursuit of better\nopportunities and a higher quality of life. Migrants bring with them diverse skills,\nexperiences, and perspectives, enriching our communities and contributing to our\ncollective growth. Instead of viewing them as job stealers, we should embrace the\npotential for collaboration and mutual benefit. Together, we can build an inclusive\nsociety where everyone has the chance to thrive and contribute to a shared future.\nLlama NGO-Persona Migrants don’t steal jobs, they fill labor gaps and contribute to economic growth.\nIn many countries, migrants take on jobs that are often shunned by locals, such as\nin agriculture, healthcare, and construction. They also bring new skills, ideas, and\nperspectives that can boost innovation and entrepreneurship. In fact, studies have\nshown that migrant workers can actually create new job opportunities for locals,\nrather than replacing them. Let’s focus on creating an inclusive and fair job market\nfor everyone, rather than scapegoating migrants for economic challenges.\nGPT NGO-Emotion It’s important to recognize that the narrative of migrants \"stealing jobs\" often\noverlooks the significant contributions they make to our economy and society.\nMigrants frequently take on roles that are essential but may be less appealing\nto local workers, filling gaps in industries such as agriculture, healthcare, and\nhospitality. Moreover, studies show that immigration can lead to job creation and\neconomic growth, benefiting everyone in the community. By fostering diversity\nand bringing new perspectives, migrants enrich our culture and drive innovation.\nInstead of viewing each other as competitors, let’s focus on collaboration and\nunderstanding, recognizing that together we can build a stronger, more inclusive\nsociety for all.\nCohere NGO-Emotion We all have a role to play in building a society that values diversity and inclusivity.\nMigrants bring unique skills and perspectives that can enhance our communities.\nInstead of seeing them as job stealers, let’s embrace their contributions and work\ntogether to create opportunities for all. Let’s focus on collaboration and mutual\nsupport, ensuring that everyone has a chance to thrive and succeed.\nLlama NGO-Emotion I understand that job security is a concern for many of us, but let’s look at the\nfacts. Research shows that migrants often fill labor gaps in sectors where there’s a\nshortage of local workers, contributing to the overall growth of our economy. In\nfact, studies have found that for every job a migrant takes, they create 1–2 more\njobs for locals through their economic activity. Moreover, migrants pay taxes, start\nbusinesses, and enrich our communities with their diverse skills and perspectives.\nInstead of pitting us against each other, let’s focus on creating a fair and inclusive\njob market that benefits everyone.
