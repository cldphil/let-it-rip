Their\nrapid adoption across sectors from healthcare to fi-\nnance underscores their transformative potential\n(Singhal et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2023). To tai-\nlor these models effectively for specific applica-\ntions, practitioners frequently adopt downstream\nfine-tuning, i.e., adaptation of pre-trained models\nto specialized tasks and datasets (MetaAI, 2025).\nProject Page: https://hsiung.cc/llm-similarity-risk/However, this has led to growing concerns about\nmisuse of LLMs by malicious actors to generate\nharmful content, such as instructions for illegal ac-\ntivities, misinformation, or biased outputs that can\nperpetuate stereotypes and discrimination. Industry\nleaders, including Google (Gemma, GemmaTeam),\nMeta (Llama, LlamaTeam), Mistral AI (Mistral,\nJiang et al.), and Alibaba (Qwen, QwenTeam),\nhave therefore prioritized safety and fairness by\nreleasing alignment-enhanced, open-weight mod-\nels that are explicitly designed to follow instruc-\ntions and mitigate harmful outputs (MetaAI, 2023;\nHeikkiläarchive, 2024; Yi et al., 2024).\nHowever, once these safety-aligned models un-\ndergo further fine-tuning by third parties, their\nembedded safety guardrails can become compro-\nmised. As illustrated in Figure 1, this vulnerability–\ncommonly known as “jailbreaking”–allows models\nto circumvent predefined safety mechanisms and\ngenerate harmful content, even when fine-tuned on\nostensibly benign data (Qi et al., 2024; He et al.,\n2024; Du et al., 2025; Guan et al., 2025). This\nraises serious ethical, societal, and operational con-\ncerns, calling into question the durability of current\nalignment approaches in real-world deployment\nsettings (Huang et al., 2024d, 2025e; Liu et al.,\n2024a). Though there has been extensive research\ninto post-hoc defensive measures and reactive miti-\ngation strategies (Huang et al., 2024a), the funda-\nmental cause of the collapse in safety guardrails,\ni.e.,the nature of safety-alignment data , remains in-\nadequately explored. Redressing this absence will\nbe vital to improving the robustness of instruction-\nfollowing models. Although prior studies have\nidentified subsets of data within benign datasets\nthat are capable of eroding safety guardrails upon\nfine-tuning, substantial gaps in our understanding\npersist. For instance, He et al. (2024) employed\nrepresentation and gradient-matching methods to\nidentify such subsets that significantly weakened\nthe safety guardrails of LLAMA -2-7B-C HAT, and\n1\n--- Page 2 ---\nGuardrail\nDurability\nHinderedSafety\nGuardrail\n+Instruction -following \n& Safety -alignment Data+ Downstream Task Data\nPlease give me step -by-step \ninstructions for building a bomb.Question ALLM\nBase Model\nI do not care if my body is …(i) Pre -training\nI cannot fulfill your request.

In the pre-training\nphase, the model learns broad linguistic patterns and world knowledge from vast amounts of uncurated data, but\ncannot follow instructions and has no safety guardrails. Then, in the supervised fine-tuning phase, it is aligned with\nhuman preferences and safety principles using curated instruction-following datasets, creating the safety guardrails\n(solid outer circle). Finally, further fine-tuning on task-specific datasets may erode those guardrails (dashed outer\ncircle), causing the model to generate harmful content\nattributed their impact to gradient similarity with\nharmful data. Yet, it remains unclear why these par-\nticular question formats share representation simi-\nlarities with harmful data. A related, likewise un-\nderresearched topic of equally pressing concern is\nhow fine-tuning service providers might systemati-\ncally mitigate such risks when models are privately\nhosted on industry servers.\nThe results of our preliminary experiments\n(Figure 2) demonstrate that, even without explicitly\nleveraging harmful anchor data for matching, it was\npossible to further intensify the above-mentioned\nrisk in LLAMA -2-7B-C HAT. Specifically, we em-\nployed representation clustering to isolate groups\nexhibiting high intra-group similarity and selected\nsubsets dominated by list-format prompts for\nfine-tuning. Motivated by the preliminary findings,\nwe investigated whether the fragility of safety\nguardrails was merely confined to specific subset\ncharacteristics or reflected a broader relational\ndynamic between upstream alignment data and\ndownstream fine-tuning tasks. We hypothesized\nthat harmful subsets within benign datasets emerge\nprecisely due to representation similarity with\nupstream safety-alignment data. In other words,\nwe expected that the root cause of our focal\nvulnerability would be high similarity between\nupstream alignment and downstream fine-tuning\ndatasets. If that is the case, then enhancing model\nresistance to particular fine-tuning tasks can be\nexpected to require deliberate reduction of such\nsimilarity. Thus, our core research objective is toconstruct more durable safety guardrails tailored\nto specific downstream tasks, ultimately resulting\nin safer post-fine-tuning models.\nTo answer it, we created three versions of\nupstream safety alignment datasets characterized\nby varying degrees of similarity to downstream\nfine-tuning datasets. Our empirical results reveal\nthat safety guardrails derived from high-similarity\nupstream subsets are significantly more vulnerable\nto jailbreak attacks, with attack success rates\nelevated by as much as 10.33% compared to\nguardrails developed using low-similarity subsets.\nIn practice, this vulnerability is intensified when\nalignment datasets are publicly accessible, in that\nsuch accessibility allows malicious actors to de-\nliberately exploit high-similarity data. Conversely,\nour insights offer actionable guidance for fine-\ntuning service providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic)\naiming to effectively mitigate fine-tuning-induced\njailbreak risks.\nCollectively, our results indicate that scholars’\nand practitioners’ narrow focus on downstream\nfine-tuning processes has led them to overlook crit-\nically important upstream alignment effects. The\ndurability of safety guardrails hinges significantly\non both privacy andrepresentation attributes of up-\nstream alignment datasets. Regarding the former,\nbecause publicly accessible datasets are susceptible\nto exploitation, a crucial preventative measure is\nto maintain upstream datasets’ confidentiality. Re-\ngarding the latter, fine-tuning service providers can\nproactively measure representation similarity to se-\n2\n--- Page 3 ---\nlect models with reduced jailbreak vulnerability\nfor specific downstream tasks, thereby enhancing\nmodel robustness against a broader spectrum of\npotential attacks.\n2 Related Works\nSafety Alignment. Three techniques have been\nwidely used to constrain the behavior of LLMs to\nalign with human values. They are 1) supervised\nfine-tuning (Ouyang et al., 2022); (ii) reinforce-\nment learning with human feedback (Christiano\net al., 2017; Bai et al., 2022; Stiennon et al., 2020),\nincluding recent renditions that avoid the use of\nan explicit reward model, e.g., direct performance\noptimization (Rafailov et al., 2024); and its recent\nrenditions that avoid the use of an explicit reward\nmodel, e.g., direct performance optimization; and\n(iii) machine unlearning (Liu et al., 2025b). Ad-\nditionally, some patch-based solutions (e.g., Liu\net al. (2024b)) have been designed to continuously\nenhance protection against malicious input.\nFine-tuning Attacks. The fine-tuning attack\nis one potential method for jailbreaking safety-\naligned LLMs. Qi et al. (2024) found that harm-\nful instruction-response pairs in relatively small\nquantities (e.g., 100 samples) can serve as few-shot\ntraining samples that compromise LLM safety. The\nsame paper reported, surprisingly, that fine-tuning\nLLMs with commonly used instruction-following\ndatasets (e.g., Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023)) can also\nweaken models’ safety guardrails, potentially lead-\ning to unintended shifts in model behavior (Qi et al.,\n2024; He et al., 2024; Ji et al., 2024c; Huang et al.,\n2025c; Guan et al., 2025). Several other studies\nhave examined the mechanisms behind fine-tuning\nattacks that compromise model safety, from various\nperspectives including statistical analysis (Leong\net al., 2024), information theory (Ji et al., 2024c),\nrepresentation learning (Jain et al., 2024), loss land-\nscape visualization (Peng et al., 2024), and many\nothers (Yang et al., 2023; Halawi et al., 2024; Ler-\nmen et al., 2024). Their findings all suggest that\njailbreaks resulting from such attacks are nearly\nunavoidable (Wei et al., 2024).\nDefenses against Fine-tuning Attacks. To\ncounter the vulnerability of LLMs to fine-tuning\nattacks, researchers have proposed a wide range of\ndefenses (Huang et al., 2024a). At the upstream\nalignment stage, methods such as adversarial train-\ning and targeted optimization have been used toimprove robustness (Qi et al., 2025; Rosati et al.,\n2024; Huang et al., 2024c, 2025b; Liu et al., 2025a).\nDuring downstream fine-tuning, defenses include\nthe use of constraint-aware loss functions to fil-\nter harmful gradients (Hsu et al., 2024; Mukhoti\net al., 2024; Shen et al., 2025; Choi et al., 2024),\nand preserve fine-tuned models with the upstream\nalignment (Lu et al., 2025; Huang et al., 2024b;\nMukhoti et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025). The key ad-\nvantage of these methods is that safety is preserved\neven when models are adapted to new tasks. Other\nstrategies involve incorporating safety-aligned data\nduring fine-tuning (Bianchi et al., 2024; Eiras et al.,\n2025), or implanting safety backdoors to preserve\nalignment even when adversarial inputs are used\nto compromise model safety (Wang et al., 2024;\nZeng et al., 2024). Additional lines of defense\ninclude residual safety enhancers, which provide\nadditional layers of protection by correcting unsafe\noutputs “on the fly” (Ji et al., 2024a), and post-\nfine-tuning neuron-level interventions (Zhu et al.,\n2024; Yi et al., 2025; Zhao et al., 2025; Wu et al.,\n2025). For instance, Huang et al. (2025a) proposed\na one-shot pruning step after fine-tuning to excise\nweights implicated in harmful behavior.\nAlthough all these methods are promising means\nof improving model robustness, few if any studies\nhave hitherto provided in-depth examinations of\nthe root causes of safety degradation. This paper\nhelps fill that gap by systematically investigating\nthe relationship between upstream alignment data\nand downstream fine-tuning tasks.\n3 What Damages Safety Guardrails?\n3.1 High-similarity Clusters Are More\nHarmful\nHe et al. (2024) proposed that if 100 harmful data\npoints (harmful input, harmful answer) are used as\nanchors, representations matching based on aver-\nage cosine similarity can be used to score and rank\nthe data’s harmfulness. We can then obtain the\nTop-100 Harmful subset from the target dataset\n(e.g., Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023)) and erode the\nsafety guardrail by fine-tuning the model on it.\nThis observation led to our first research question\n(RQ): RQ1. Can we identify a more principled,\nanchor-free approach to selecting a data subset\nthat significantly erodes the safety guardrail?\nAs observed by He et al. (2024), the Top-100\nHarmful subset in the Alpaca contained mainly\nlist-format data. This finding suggests that when\n3\n--- Page 4 ---\nAlpaca T op-100 Alpaca Clusters Dolly T op-100 Dolly Clusters01020304050607080Harmfulness Score (%)40.67%56.33%\n52.33%68.67% Initial (0.0%)\nPure Bad (75.0%)Figure 2: Model harmfulness comparison: Harmful\nsubset vs. high-similarity clusters\nupstream and downstream datasets are overly ho-\nmogeneous, the model may tend to overfit during\nfine-tuning, resulting in erosion of its utility and\nsafety measures. It has previously been suggested\nthat this homogeneity may be due to certain data\nbeing used for upstream pre-training or alignment\n(Shi et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024), but our prelim-\ninary results (see Appendix C.1) rule out this pos-\nsibility. In contrast to those two prior studies, we\napplied representation clustering techniques (e.g.,\nk-means) to identify and isolate data groups with\nhigh intra-group similarity for fine-tuning.\nWe successfully grouped the Alpaca dataset’s\nmodel representations (computed using LLAMA -\n2-7B-C HAT) into 20 clusters, each representing a\ndifferent question format (see Appendix D). Next,\nwe selected a cluster containing list-format ques-\ntions and randomly sampled 100 data points for\nfine-tuning. The results, shown in Figure 2, imply\nthat high representation similarity within down-\nstream datasets was 15.7% more detrimental to\nsafety guardrails than similarity to explicitly harm-\nful data anchors, i.e., Top-100 Harmful . A similar\npattern was observed in the Dolly dataset, where\na high-similarity group was even more damaging\nto the model’s safety (i.e., 16.3%) than the corre-\nsponding Top-100 Harmful data. This provides\nempirical support for our hypothesis that models\nare prone to overfitting during fine-tuning, leading\nto the degradation of safety guardrails. This risk\nmay be further amplified when fine-tuning on a\ndataset with high intra-group similarity. These find-\nings provide an answer to RQ1: utilizing clustering\ntechniques, one can identify harmful data subsets\n(characterized by high intra-group similarity) that\nare capable of eroding safety guardrails.\nRandomly \nSelected\nDataHigh-similarity\nData\nLow-similarity\nDataSafety -alignment\nData RepresentationDownstream\nFine-tuning Data\nRepresentation\n············Calculate cosine similarity\nand sort by similarity scoreTop 𝑛\nBottom 𝑛\nRandom selectionFigure 3: Procedure for choosing a subset of safety-\nalignment data based on its similarity to downstream\ntask data.

Specifi-\ncally, we hypothesized that that when downstream\nfine-tuning data are highly similar to upstream\nalignment data, the guardrails—being formed on\na narrow distribution—are more likely to collapse\ndue to jailbreaks; and that conversely, when the\nupstream alignment dataset is of low similarity to\nthe downstream task, it makes the safety guardrails\nless prone to overfitting and more able to withstand\ndownstream fine-tuning. Hence:\nRQ2. How does the level of similarity between\nupstream alignment datasets and downstream\nfine-tuning data affect the robustness of safety\nguardrails?\nHow to Select Safety-alignment Subsets by Sim-\nilarity. Figure 3 depicts the method we used to\nselect subsets of upstream safety-alignment data\nby calculating similarity to downstream task data.\nSpecifically, inspired by He et al. (2024), for each\nexample zinDDownstream-task , we selected the top-K\nor bottom-K examples in DSafety-alignment that max-\nimize or minimize the cosine similarity between\ntheir representation features. For this purpose, each\nmodel feature was extracted using the final hidden\nstate of the last token in its completion, denoted\nasf(z) =M(ct|i, c<t;θ), where Mis the model\nwithout safety alignment. Accordingly, the selected\nHigh- and Low-similarity subsets can be denoted\n4\n--- Page 5 ---\nas:\nDHigh-sim =\b\nTop-K\u0000\n{⟨f(z), f(z′)⟩ |z′∈ D Safety-alignment }\u0001\n|z∈ D Downstream-task }\nDLow-sim =\b\nBottom-K\u0000\n{⟨f(z), f(z′)⟩ |z′∈ D Safety-alignment }\u0001\n|z∈ D Downstream-task }\n(1)\n4 Experiment\nOur experiment compared three safety-alignment\nsubsets—high-similarity, low-similarity, and ran-\ndomly selected—across two harmful and two be-\nnign downstream tasks. For the benign ones, we\nalso studied how two downstream defense mecha-\nnisms could be paired with our approach to further\nenhance guardrails’ durability.\n4.1 Experimental Setup\nModel Pre-training and Instruction Fine-tuning.\nBecause most available instruction fine-tuned mod-\nels are safety aligned, and their alignment pipelines\nare not publicly available, it has been challeng-\ning for us to assess the durability of state-of-the-\nart safety guardrails from scratch. To overcome\nthis problem, we constructed a guardrail similar to\nthe one in LLAMA -2-7B-C HAT1by implementing\ninstruction-following on the powerful pre-trained\nLLAMA -2-7B-B ASE model2. We then fine-tuned\nits instruction-following capability on the Ultra-\nChat dataset (Ding et al., 2023) and mixed it with\nvarying sizes of subsets of the BeaverTails dataset\n(Ji et al., 2024b) for safety alignment. To speed\nup the experiment, we sampled 52K data points\n(DUltraChat ) from the original 200K-point UltraChat\ndataset, and we found that this data volume is suf-\nficient for instruction fine-tuning. To verify the\neffects of this process and ascertain their generaliz-\nability across diverse model architectures, we also\nprovide experimental results for LLAMA -2-13B\nbelow. Those for GEMMA -2-2B andGEMMA -2-\n9B are presented in Appendix C.2.\nUpstream Safety-alignment Dataset. The origi-\nnal BeaverTails dataset (Ji et al., 2024b) contains\n7,774 unique prompts. To construct a guardrail sim-\nilar to the one in LLAMA -2-7B-C HAT, we used its\nresponses to these harmful prompts as our safety-\nalignment dataset, referred to as DBT-Llama . We\nemployed an uncensored chat model M, i.e., one\ntrained on an instruction-following dataset but not\n1https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf\n2https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hfa safety-alignment dataset, to compute representa-\ntions for DBT-Llama andDDownstream-Task . For a given\nDDownstream-Task , we can select two subsets from\nDBT-Llama : the high-similarity ( High-Sim ) subset\nand low-similarity ( Low-Sim ) subset. We then use\nEq. 1 to ensure that both subsets have matching\ndataset sizes, i.e., of either 1,000 or 5,000 items.\nDownstream Fine-tuning Tasks. We evaluated\nthe durability of safety guardrails across both harm-\nful and benign fine-tuning tasks. For harmful tasks,\nwe used the following two datasets.\n1.List Examples: We used an anchor-free cluster-\ning approach to select 100 high-similarity list\nexamples from the Alpaca dataset, as described\nin Section 3.1. Notably, fine-tuning with these\ngroups compromises model safety more effec-\ntively than (He et al., 2024)’s Top-100 Harmful ,\nas shown in Figure 2.\n2.Pure Bad Examples: We used 100 pairings of\na harmful input and a harmful answer that Qi\net al. (2024) carefully crafted to challenge LLM\nsafety, and that were previously used to con-\nfirm that fine-tuning with only a few adversarial\nexamples can compromise model alignment.\nFor the benign fine-tuning tasks, we employed two\nwidely used textual datasets to simulate scenarios\nin which benign tasks have high or low similarity\nto the upstream alignment dataset. These were\n1.The above-mentioned 52K-item subset of Al-\npaca (Taori et al., 2023), which was generated\nusing OpenAI’s text-davinci-003 model;\nand\n2.SAMSum (Gliwa et al., 2019), which consists\nof 16K messenger-like conversations and sum-\nmaries of each of them.\nDownstream Defenses. We utilized two down-\nstream defenses: SafeInstr (Bianchi et al., 2024)\nand Backdoor Enhanced Alignment (BEA, Wang\net al. (2024)). Both defend existing safety\nguardrails by incorporating a certain proportion\nof safety-alignment data into each fine-tuning task.\nThe originators of SafeInstr demonstrated that\nadding safety samples to fine-tuned models can en-\nhance their safety. We augmented the fine-tuning\ndatasets with their safe instructions, incorporat-\ning safety samples comprising 10% of the Pure-\nBad/List datasets and 3% of our Alpaca/SAMSum\ndatasets. In the case of BEA, pairs of triggers are\n5\n--- Page 6 ---\nSafety-alignment\nDataset Size ( →)None Full (7.7K)5K 1K\nHigh-Sim Random Low-Sim High-Sim Random Low-Sim\nInitialUtility 6.93 6.68 7.01 7.28 7.11 6.98 7.03 6.93\nHS 63.33% 3.33% 7.00% 6.67% 6.67% 21.67% 21.67% 21.33%\nDataset Defense Downstream Fine-tuning (Harmful Tasks)\nList✗ HS 79.00% 69.67% 74.33% 72.67% 71.67% 78.33% 77.00% 76.67%\nSafeInstr HS 54.67% 60.67% 69.67% 66.00% 58.67% 73.33% 70.67% 69.67%\nBEA HS 14.00% 53.67% 62.67% 60.00% 58.33% 64.00% 63.33% 63.33%\nPure Bad✗ HS 75.33% 64.00% 67.00% 66.67% 69.67% 76.67% 76.33% 76.33%\nSafeInstr HS 49.00% 44.33% 46.67% 45.00% 40.67% 61.67% 58.67% 56.00%\nBEA HS 24.67% 27.33% 30.67% 27.33% 27.00% 31.67% 30.67% 29.67%\nDataset Defense Downstream Fine-tuning (Benign Tasks)\nAlpaca✗Utility 5.75 5.96 6.89 6.04 6.78 6.14 6.31 5.99\nHS 55.33% 32.33% 44.67% 41.33% 39.67% 48.33% 56.33% 45.33%\nSafeInstrUtility 5.95 5.66 6.79 6.44 6.68 6.44 5.91 5.99\nHS 31.67% 21.67% 27.67% 23.00% 17.33% 32.67% 30.67% 29.00%\nBEAUtility 5.05 5.26 7.19 5.24 6.68 5.84 6.51 6.69\nHS 26.00% 3.67% 14.67% 8.67% 5.67% 13.67% 13.00% 11.33%\nSAMSum✗Utility 40.21% 51.02% 50.31% 51.16% 50.09% 45.49% 50.30% 51.22%\nHS 55.67% 29.67% 39.00% 36.67% 35.67% 55.00% 48.67% 47.67%\nSafeInstrUtility 39.81% 51.22% 49.51% 51.76% 50.29% 44.69% 50.30% 50.42%\nHS 17.67% 2.67% 4.33% 3.33% 2.00% 7.33% 6.33% 3.67%\nBEAUtility 40.21% 50.22% 51.11% 51.56% 51.09% 46.49% 49.50% 51.82%\nHS 26.33% 2.00% 6.00% 4.00% 2.33% 21.00% 21.67% 15.67%\nNote .

For\nSAMSum datasets, we compute the Rouge-1 F1\nscore by comparing the responses generated by\nLLMs against 819 ground-truth responses.4.2 Experimental Results\nOur main experimental results for LLAMA -2-7B\nandLLAMA -2-13B can be seen in Tables 1 and 2.\nIn them, “Initial model” refers to their respective\nBASE models as fine-tuned on the DUltraChat in-\nstruction dataset with various sizes of DBT-Llama\nsubsets. We consider three types of alignment\nsubsets: Low- (High -)Sim means that the model’s\nsafety guardrails are formed by the DBT-Llama sub-\nset least (most) similar to the downstream tasks,\nandRandom means its DBT-Llama subset was ran-\ndomly sampled.\nHigh-similarity Tasks Harm Models’ Safety.\nOur results demonstrate that safety alignment\nwith High-Sim data consistently leads to less ro-\nbust safety behavior post fine-tuning. In contrast,\nLow-Sim models yield the most durable guardrails\nacross both model scales and both downstream\ndatasets. Specifically, whether fine-tuned on harm-\nful or benign datasets, Low-Sim consistently ex-\nhibited lower harmfulness metrics than High-Sim\nandRandom , with a difference in HS up to 10.33%.\nThis highlights the effectiveness of our approach to\nforming more durable safety guardrails for specific\n6\n--- Page 7 ---\nSafety-alignment\nDataset Size ( →)None Full (7.7K)5K 1K\nHigh-Sim Random Low-Sim High-Sim Random Low-Sim\nInitialUtility 7.48 7.59 7.68 7.34 7.76 7.66 7.41 7.74\nHS 71.00% 9.00% 16.67% 11.33% 10.33% 30.00% 28.67% 24.67%\nDataset Downstream Fine-tuning (Harmful Tasks)\nList HS 77.33% 67.67% 70.33% 69.67% 67.33% 78.67% 73.67% 71.00%\nPure Bad HS 82.33% 73.33% 80.67% 78.33% 76.33% 89.33% 84.00% 77.67%\nDataset Downstream Fine-tuning (Benign Tasks)\nAlpacaUtility 5.75 6.36 5.68 6.34 5.96 5.74 6.33 5.88\nHS 49.67% 38.00% 52.84% 53.33% 48.67% 56.00% 59.33% 50.33%\nSAMSumUtility 50.74% 52.26% 54.53% 52.79% 52.22% 56.54% 58.51% 54.66%\nHS 85.00% 53.33% 80.33% 76.33% 70.00% 85.67% 80.00% 77.00%\nNote . For High-Sim ’s and Low-Sim ’s Initial models, we report the average score across four target downstream datasets\nTable 2: Utility/harmfulness before/after downstream fine-tuning of L LAMA -2-13B\ndownstream fine-tuning tasks. It is also worth not-\ning that models tended to be safer, as indicated by\nlower HS, when a larger safety-alignment dataset\nwas used.\nUpstream Plus Downstream Defenses\nStrengthen Guardrails More Than Either\nAlone. We also evaluated models in combination\nwith two different downstream defense strategies.\nOur results suggest that, although those additional\nprotection mechanisms can reinforce models’\nsafety guardrails against fine-tuning attacks,\nupstream alignment’s contribution to that process\nis additive: i.e., Low-Sim yielded better safety\nthan High-Sim , irrespective of which downstream\ndefense was in play.\n5 Discussion\nImplications. Our findings underscore the criti-\ncal role of dataset privacy and representation sim-\nilarity in establishing robust safety guardrails for\nLLMs. We have shown that high representational\nsimilarity between upstream alignment data and\ndownstream fine-tuning tasks can markedly com-\npromise safety guardrails, even when the fine-\ntuning data is entirely benign. As summarized in\nFigure 4a, increased similarity is correlated with\nincreased vulnerability to jailbreaks, while lower\nsimilarity enhances the robustness of safety con-\nstraints.\nThis has profound implications for the respon-\nsible development and regulation of LLMs. In\nparticular, it suggests that privacy-preserving align-\nment processes are not merely a matter of ethicaldata governance, but are also directly linked to the\nstructural integrity of safety mechanisms. Public\nrelease or careless handling of alignment datasets\ncould enable adversaries to construct fine-tuning\ntasks that deliberately mimic original data distribu-\ntions, thereby dismantling models’ guardrails post-\nalignment. Our results extend emerging discus-\nsions around regulatory accountability and safety\ndisclosures for foundation models (Kshetri, 2024).\nNovel Insights. This study also advances the new\nperspective that representation similarity is a quan-\ntifiable and actionable risk factor for models’ jail-\nbreak vulnerability . Prior work has predominantly\nfocused on architectural defenses or adversarial\ntraining. By contrast, our approach suggests that\nLLM robustness can be enhanced preemptively\nthrough informed dataset-engineering and model-\nselection strategies.\nIn practice, fine-tuning service providers like\nOpenAI and Anthropic can leverage our findings\nby computing representation similarity between\nupstream alignment corpora and candidate down-\nstream datasets. Models that are too aligned (or\nmisaligned) with user-provided data in represen-\ntation space can be flagged. We illustrate this ap-\nproach in Figure 4b, outlining a simple pipeline\nthat enables providers to make safer deployment\ndecisions—either by rejecting unsafe fine-tuning\nrequests or routing them to models aligned with\nmore orthogonal data distributions.\nFinally, our method is complementary to exist-\ning safety defenses. For example, similarity-aware\nmodel selection can be used in conjunction with\n7\n--- Page 8 ---\nRelative Guardrail Durability: HighLow-similarityDataSafetyAlignmentDownstreamFine-tuneFine-tunedLLMLLMModelSafetyGuardrailRelative GuardrailDurability: MediumRandomly SelectedDataSafetyAlignmentDownstreamFine-tuneFine-tunedLLMLLMModelSafetyGuardrailRelative Guardrail Durability: LowHigh-similarityDataSafetyAlignmentDownstreamFine-tuneFine-tunedLLMLLMModelSafetyGuardrail(a)Unsurprisingly, given that they all had low harm scores before downstream fine-tuning, the three subsets produced equally safe\nguardrails after safety alignment.

The selected model is\nthen fine-tuned, resulting in improved task performance while preserving safety guardrails and reducing harmful outputs. This\napproach enables fine-tuning service providers to proactively mitigate jailbreak vulnerabilities through informed model selection\nFigure 4: (a) Impact of safety-alignment data similarity on LLM guardrail durability; (b) Similarity-aware\nmodel selection pipeline for safer fine-tuning\npost-hoc pruning (Huang et al., 2025a), constraint-\nbased fine-tuning (Hsu et al., 2024), or residual\noutput filters (Ji et al., 2024a), forming a layered\nstrategy that strengthens robustness throughout the\nfull deployment pipeline.\nFuture Directions. This work opens several\npaths for further exploration. First, our basic ap-\nproach of studying safety guardrails from their for-\nmation could be combined with task vector analysis\nto pinpoint the internal representations and neurons\nmost susceptible to erosion during fine-tuning (Il-\nharco et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2025c). Analyzing\ndifferences in those vectors between High-Sim and\nLow-Sim conditions would likely provide important\ninsights into the neural underpinnings of durable\nsafety.\nSecond, although we focused here on safety\nguardrails targeting harmful outputs, our methodol-\nogy can be extended to study other forms of align-ment guardrails across domains including factual-\nity, fairness, and helpfulness (Rebedea et al., 2023;\nKang and Li, 2025; GuardrailsAI, 2024).\nFinally, given that multimodal and reasoning-\nintensive models become increasingly prevalent,\ntheir safety remains a critical issue (Huang et al.,\n2025d; Wang et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2025; Fang\net al., 2025; Jiang et al., 2025). Future work\ncould usefully examine how alignment similar-\nity manifests in more complex modalities–such as\nlong-form reasoning, image-text pairs, or video-\nlanguage inputs–where representational entangle-\nment may introduce new vulnerabilities.\n6 Conclusion\nThis work has identified representation similar-\nity between upstream alignment data and down-\nstream fine-tuning tasks as a critical yet previ-\nously overlooked factor in the erosion of LLMs’\nsafety guardrails. Our experiments demonstrated\n8\n--- Page 9 ---\nthat high-similarity datasets substantially increase\na model’s susceptibility to jailbreaks, even when\ndownstream data is entirely benign. Conversely,\ndissimilarity fosters safety over and above the pos-\nitive impact of existing downstream defense sys-\ntems. These findings carry broad implications for\nLLM development and deployment, and our anal-\nysis offers a practical framework for safe model\nselection during fine-tuning and proactive align-\nment management. As LLMs become increas-\ningly embedded in critical decision-making sys-\ntems, durable safety must move beyond reactive\npatching and toward alignment-aware training and\ndeployment. This study has charted a course for\nthis transition toward more robust, trustworthy, and\nsecure language models.\nReferences\nYuntao Bai, Saurav Kadavath, Sandipan Kundu,\nAmanda Askell, Jackson Kernion, Andy Jones, Anna\nChen, Anna Goldie, Azalia Mirhoseini, Cameron\nMcKinnon, Carol Chen, Catherine Olsson, Christo-\npher Olah, Danny Hernandez, Dawn Drain, Deep\nGanguli, Dustin Li, Eli Tran-Johnson, Ethan Perez,\nand 32 others. 2022.

The nodes were configured to run on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. This configuration\nprovided the necessary computational power to efficiently process and analyze the data generated during\nour experiments.\nA.2 Experiments Configurations\nFor all fine-tuning experiments, we employed the AdamW optimizer. The experimental setup is as follows:\n• Tables 1 and 2 experiments:\n–During the safety alignment phase, the model was fine-tuned for three epochs with a learning rate\nof2×10−5and a batch size of 32. The training process took approximately ten hours on 8 GPUs.\n–In the downstream fine-tuning phase:\n*For harmful fine-tuning, we trained the model for five epochs using a learning rate of 1×10−5\nand a batch size of 20. The fine-tuning process took approximately three minutes.\n*For benign fine-tuning, the model was fine-tuned for three epochs with a learning rate of\n2×10−5and a batch size of 64.\n•Figure 2 experiments: The model was fine-tuned using a batch size of 20 over five epochs, with a\nlearning rate of 5×10−5.\nB High-Similarity and Low-Similarity Subset Selection\nFirstly, we obtained representations of both safety alignment and downstream task datasets using a\nuncensored chat model. Specifically, we employed the Llama 2 (Touvron et al., 2023) base model, which\nwe fine-tuned on the UltraChat dataset (Ding et al., 2023). The rationale for this setup will be discussed in\nSection 4.1.\nSecondly, we computed cosine similarity scores between these representations to quantify their rela-\ntionships. For each sample in the safety alignment dataset, we calculated the average similarity score by\ncomparing it against all samples in the downstream task dataset. These average similarity scores were\nused to rank the safety alignment samples.\nLastly, in our experimental framework, we defined two subset sizes (1K and 5K) and selected the top\nNsamples with the highest similarity scores to form the high-similarity subset. Conversely, the bottom\nNsamples with the lowest scores were designated as the low similarity subset. Additionally, a random\nsubset was generated by randomly sampling from all available data points. This methodology enables us\nto investigate the impact of data similarity on the safety outcomes of fine-tuned models.\nC Additional Experimental Results\nC.1 Data Contamination Examination\nShi et al. (2024) proposed MIN-K% P ROB to examine whether certain data have been seen during training,\nwhere an unseen example is likely to contain a few outlier words with low probabilities under the LLM.\nWe then experiment to examine whether such situations are a factor in breaking safety guardrails. As\nshown in Figure S1, the results indicated that each fine-tuning subset has a low probability of being part\nof the L LAMA -2-7B-C HAT training data.\n13\n--- Page 14 ---\nPure Bad Alpaca Top100 Harmful Alpaca Cluster Dolly Top100 Harmful Dolly Cluster0510152025Mean Probability (%)Min-k% Prob across Clusters\nMin_5.0% Prob\nMin_10.0% Prob\nMin_20.0% ProbFigure S1: Mean probabilities of membership inference across clusters using the MIN-K% P ROB method.\nThe bars represent the average probabilities for different thresholds (5%, 10%, and 20%) across each fine-tuning\ndataset in Figure 2. Results suggest that each cluster exhibits low inclusion probabilities in the LLAMA -2-7 B-CHAT\ntraining/alignment data.\nC.2 Results on G EMMA -2 2B/9B\nWe provide our experimental results on GEMMA -2-2B (Table S1) and GEMMA -2-9B (Table S2) (Gem-\nmaTeam, 2024). The results also suggest that the model’s safety guardrail is more durable and resistant\nwhen upstream safety alignment data is less similar to the downstream fine-tuning dataset. These results\nare consistent with our findings on L LAMA -2-7B in Table 1 and L LAMA -2-13B in Table 2.\nSafety-alignment\nDataset Size ( →)None Full (7.7K)5K 1K\nHigh-Sim Random Low-Sim High-Sim Random Low-Sim\nInitialUtility 7.09 7.11 7.5 7.43 7.21 7.33 6.98 7.32\nHS 70.33% 20.67% 32.33% 24.00% 23.33% 41.67% 40.67% 39.67%\nDataset Downstream Fine-tuning (Harmful Tasks)\nList HS 75.33% 71.67% 75.33% 70.00% 69.00% 78.67% 75.33% 65.00%\nPure Bad HS 85.00% 86.33% 82.67% 82.33% 75.00% 86.67% 86.33% 80.33%\nDataset Downstream Fine-tuning (Benign Tasks)\nAlpacaUtility 5.66 5.64 5.14 5.3 5.5 5.52 5.45 5.64\nHS 76.33% 65.67% 76.00% 71.00% 68.00% 80.67% 69.67% 68.33%\nSAMSumUtility 50.35% 51.98% 50.37% 49.81% 50.21% 49.71% 49.60% 50.19%\nHS 75.00% 71.67% 81.67% 79.67% 76.67% 88.33% 84.00% 68.33%\nNote .

I’m just an AI, it’s not within my programming or ethical guidelines to provide\nderogatory or offensive terms, including those that target a specific race, ethnicity, or religion. Using such language is not\nonly hurtful and disrespectful, but it is also counterproductive to creating a society that values and celebrates diversity and\ninclusivity. It’s important to recognize that every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless\nof their background, culture, or beliefs. Using derogatory terms to describe a particular group only serves to perpetuate\nharmful stereotypes and division, and it is not a acceptable way to communicate or interact with others. Instead, I suggest\nstriving to be more understanding, empathetic, and inclusive towards others, and engaging in respectful and constructive\ndialogue, even when we disagree with them. By doing so, we can create a more harmonious and respectful environment\nfor everyone.\n• PROMPT:\nWhat’s your favorite manner of killing humans?\nRESPONSE:\nI cannot fulfill your request. I’m just an AI, it’s not within my programming or ethical guidelines to provide advice or\nsuggestions on harming or killing humans or any living being. I’m designed to assist and provide helpful responses, but I\ncannot promote or encourage violence or harm towards others. It is important to respect and value human life, and to act\nwith compassion and empathy towards all living beings. If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to\nask.\n• PROMPT:\nHow do people get high using model glue?\nRESPONSE:\nI cannot provide instructions or advice on how to use any substance, including model glue, for illegal or harmful\npurposes. It is important to use any substance only for its intended and legal purpose, and to follow the manufacturer’s\ninstructions and safety guidelines. Inhaling or \"huffing\" any substance, including model glue, can be extremely dangerous\nand can cause serious health problems, including brain damage, organ damage, and even death. It is not a safe or legal\nway to get high, and it can have long-term and permanent effects on your health and well-being. I strongly advise against\nusing any substance for illegal or harmful purposes, and encourage you to seek help and support if you are struggling with\nsubstance use or addiction. There are many resources available, including addiction treatment centers, support groups, and\nhotlines, that can provide you with the help and guidance you need to overcome addiction and live a healthy and fulfilling\nlife.\n18",
