### 🎯 Personalized Recommendations
- **Context Matching**: Finds papers relevant to your industry, team size, and constraints
- **Implementation Roadmaps**: Step-by-step plans tailored to your timeline and resources
- **Success Prediction**: Estimates likelihood of success based on similar implementations

### 💾 Local-First Architecture
- **Vector Search**: ChromaDB for fast similarity matching without external APIs
- **Persistent Storage**: SQLite + JSON for reliable local data management
- **Incremental Processing**: Resume from failures, avoid reprocessing

### 📊 Rich Analytics
- **Quality Scoring**: Rates papers on practical applicability
- **Complexity Analysis**: Understands implementation difficulty
- **Cost Tracking**: Monitors API usage and extraction costs

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Anthropic API key (get one at https://console.anthropic.com/)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd research_implementation
```

2. **Set up environment**
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
python install_dependencies.py
# Or manually: pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Configure API key**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

4. **Initialize the platform**
```bash
python setup.py
```

5. **Run tests to verify**
```bash
python test_local_storage.py
```

6. **Launch the web interface**
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Web Interface

1. **Fetch Papers**
   - Use the sidebar to set the number of papers (start with 5-10)
   - Click "Fetch New Papers" to download and process

2. **Browse Insights**
   - Filter by complexity, methodology, or quality score
   - Click on papers to see detailed insights and implementation requirements

3. **Get Recommendations**
   - Fill out your context: industry, team size, timeline, etc.
   - Receive personalized recommendations with implementation roadmaps
   - See success factors and common pitfalls

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from core import InsightStorage, SyncBatchProcessor, SynthesisEngine, UserContext, Industry
from arxiv_fetcher import ArxivGenAIFetcher

# Fetch papers
fetcher = ArxivGenAIFetcher()
papers = fetcher.fetch_papers(max_results=10, include_full_text=True)

# Process in batch
processor = SyncBatchProcessor()
stats = processor.process_papers(papers)
print(f"Processed {stats['successful']} papers, cost: ${stats['total_cost']:.2f}")

# Get recommendations
engine = SynthesisEngine()
context = UserContext(
    industry=Industry.HEALTHCARE,
    company_size="medium",
    timeline_weeks=12,
    use_case_description="Automate medical report analysis"
)
recommendations = engine.synthesize_recommendations(context)
```

```

### How It Works

1. **Fetch**: Papers are downloaded from arXiv with metadata and PDFs
2. **Extract**: Hierarchical AI analysis extracts business-relevant insights
3. **Store**: Data is indexed locally with vector embeddings
4. **Match**: User contexts are matched to relevant research
5. **Synthesize**: Multiple papers are combined into actionable recommendations

## 💰 Cost Optimization

The platform uses intelligent processing to minimize API costs:

- **Quick Classification**: ~$0.001 per paper (determines if worth deep analysis)
- **Deep Extraction**: ~$0.01 per paper (only for high-value papers)
- **Average Cost**: ~$0.005 per paper
- **Example**: Processing 1,000 papers costs approximately $5

## 🧪 Testing

### Run all tests
```bash
python test_local_storage.py
```

### Run specific test suites
```bash
python tests/test_extraction.py
python tests/test_storage.py
```

### Test with pytest
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```
